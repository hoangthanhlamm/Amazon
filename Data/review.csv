So I‚Äôll leave the same review for both products. I was burdened with acne my whole life, not overly burdened with wide spread rash-like acne, but at least 5-10 on my face at one time. Once any part of my skin breaks or cuts it takes months to heal so I had to constantly conceal a lot of sores on my face with makeup. I had them on my neck too. I couldn‚Äôt use many moisturizers or I would just drip with oil. In my adult life my skin changed and was less oily and I could moisturize, but the acne continued. My face has never felt smooth and even to my touch and that always bothered me. Today it feels as soft as I imagine a healthy 20 year old‚Äôs would, and I‚Äôm 55! The other product I used in conjunction, and before using this one, was ‚Äú Copper Peptide Face Serum Collagen‚Äú by Complete Skin Solutions. It‚Äôs the one that is blue (true copper.)

It even looks smoother with smaller pores. I don‚Äôt have to wear heavy clogging foundation anymore. Just a tinted moisturizer and I‚Äôm good to go. Fabulous.

It's rare I get a reaction from skincare products.  However I woke up several mornings with blemishes on my face since using it.  As a licensed Esthetician who has been in the industry for several years, I have to say RETINOL PRODUCTS ARE A WASTE OF MONEY.  If you want real results I recommend consulting a Dermatologist about a low does prescription of Retin-A topical cream and mix it in with your moisturizer at night.  Retin-A is highly effective when addressing anti-aging when used properly under the supervision of a dermatologist.  Whatever Retinol or Retin-A product you use, it  is crucial you only use them at night before bed and apply sunscreen regularly during the day even when it's overcast or cloudy.

[False],0,B07GC74LL5,"I have sensitive skin and I know RIGHT AWAY when a new product is causing an allergic reaction for me. When I first used this product I had no bad reaction to it and thought I was in the clear. It‚Äôs gentle on my skin and was helping my skin look clean. But... 4 weeks into using this once a day (at night) I started developing cystic acne and other small bumps on my cheek. I thought ‚Äúokay maybe I‚Äôm ‚Äòpurging‚Äô?‚Äù But NO. Keep in mind that purging ONLY happens when you are using active ingredients i.g. (retinol, AHAs, BHAs etc.) This product does not have any active ingredients in it, meaning there‚Äôs no positive cell turnover, and cannot get deep into your pores. Which is what would cause the purging. Cetaphil is simply just to ‚Äúclean‚Äù your skin so don‚Äôt expect it to clear or do anything for your acne. Another thing to keep in mind with this cleanser is it does nothing to retain moisture. So it will dry you out, make sure to follow up with a good moisturizer after while your skin is still damp after washing it off. This cleanser  doesn‚Äôt contain Hyaluronic Acid which is a key ingredient for helping your skin by helping bind collagen and hold the water in our skin. This may work for some people and if it works for you, that‚Äôs great, I encourage you to continue using it! But for me, I felt like it caused more issues rather than taking the issues away. Please give yourself time to check it out (4 weeks or so) and research into certain products.

I recently developed Perioral Dermatitis (apparently due to stress, although that seemed far-fetched to me), and my dermatologist recommended I use a less harsh face soap. I scrapped my fancy, expensive face wash for this couple dollar bar of soap and have never been happier. With the use of an ointment from my dermatologist and the use of this soap, my dermatitis went away completely in just 2-3 weeks. I've been so happy with the way the soap feels, removes makeup and makes my skin feel after cleansing that I've decided to stick with it. Thanks to subscribe & save I never have to remember to order again! *My only disclaimer/warning is that the soap is a KILLER if it gets in your eyes.

There's even one small one that's just for your eye area. I love that everything came in an sealed bag. When I was doing my research I learned that it was important for it to be sealed away to ensure sanitary standards. Prior to buying this i was nervous about the needles and how my sensitive skin would react to it but I was so pleasantly surprised at how painless this is. I did a test run on my hand first. Then my husband volunteered for me to test it on his face. After I figured out that it was painless and didn't cause any bleeding or irritating, I went and did it on my own face. It was easy to use and i started seeing a differences in my skin after using it 3 times a week for 2 weeks. My scars are starting to vanish and my dark spots are getting lighter. Dont use if there is active pimples or inflammation. You want to wait until those are treated. Also, Make sure you sanitize the roller between each use. Failure to sanitize it can cause adverse effects on your skin. The only criticism I have is the size of the needles. Because they are so small, its painless but its not as effective as the longer ones so you have to do it a little more often to see the same results.

I previously tried the purple (nighttime) and yellow (clarifying?) and saw that these had high reviews.  I didn't like the nighttime because it didn't seem to remove all the makeup; it was too mild.  The clarifying seemed drying.  These pink ones seem less wet than the blue ones, even when I dunk them in water.  I think the added texture causes the water to be absorbed into the cloth instead of rolling off the surface.  I kind of like the extra wetness, so on that dimension, the blue ones are better.  What I like about the pink is the texture contrast between the 2 sides.  I think the fragrance is slightly more subtle, and I like it.  I'm not sure which I'll order in the future (blue or pink).  I'll probably mix it up. The one thing I don't like about all of these cloths are the size.

[False],11,B003Z4UKGM,"I have had such a terrible experience with this product and the company that I feel like I need to share. Anybody who has sensitive and acne prone skin should stay away from acure products. I had used this for a month against my better judgement. I had contacted acure 2 weeks in and they assured me that it takes a while for your pores to ""purge"" the toxic build up from previous cleansers.. I used it for another 2 weeks and send another email to the company, and it was word for word the same answer, different person. They're told what to say to you to get you to buy the product. What happened to my skin was disgusting. Acne has never been a HUGE problem for me, but acure caused it to be a huge problem. It clogged every pore in my face. Visibly clogged. There were white dots and spots all over my face. I also NEVER got cystic acne but 2 weeks into using this product I began to get it... a tiny pimple here and there turned into cystic pimples all over my face with this product. I trusted the staff as they assured me this was the purging process, but it went on and got worse with time. I have been back to my normal cleansing regimen for a while now but my skin is still recovering from these terrible products. I have never had such bad breakouts as what I had after using acure. I can't even wash my face easily with a face cloth because the pimples are so painful. I have had a terrible experience, and if you have acne prone skin STAY AWAY. These companies try to lure you in claiming the products are safe and natural and your skin will be better off for using them, but in fact a lot of natural products include shea butter, or some type of wax or butter derived from a plant. These are not good for acne prone skin. Several of Acure's face products that claim to be safe for sensitive or acne prone skin have shea butter in them. If you want to use something natural in your face regimen get the DoTERRA family physician kit that has pure tea tree oil, frankensense, and other essential oils that are PURE and UNDILUTED with crap and are good for acne prone skin.

[True],75,B0013OKSAY,"Before buying the cream in the States, I tested the product on my wrist at the store and it was fine. So I bought an unopened bottle and travel home to Vietnam with it. When I opened the bottle, it was horrendous. Cream and oil were separated. I naively thought that the cream just came out wrong because of the pump so I went ahead and applied it to my face and neck. After a few minutes, the whole face burned. I washed off the cream right away but my face and neck still have red rashes. It's also itchy and very uncomfortable. I told a friend about it and she said the same thing happened with the night cream she bought from the same product line. She did not bother to file a complain because she doesn't leave in the States. This is not supposed to happen. I have purchased many cosmetic products, including those from other Aveeno's product lines, and traveled internationally with them but none of this malfunction has happened before. The worst part about my experience is Aveeno's customer service line. Will, the product specialist, insisted that all they can do about my damage is giving me a refund in a check. I asked him to deposit the amount to my US bank account since I cannot cash out the check in Vietnam and he said he's unable to do so. After being so useless, he asked me to answer a very personal survey that would last up to 15 minutes. I stopped the survey when he asked me my date of birth as I knew it's going to get very personal. I offered to answer the survey over mail and again he said no, it has to be done over the phone. Aveeno really needs to reform their customer service policies if they want to keep their international customers. This is the most rigid and unhelpful customer service line I have ever come across in the States. What I paid for the product was not much (about 15 bucks including tax) but the least they could do is being flexible about the refund to compensate the clients' damage. That's what store credits, cash back, and other refund types are for! Instead, they choose to harass the customers with personal questions and cut corners by rounding down the retail price of the product. The customer service specialist said he will put a check of $13 in the mail for me, as it is the average retail price. The $2 difference does not make me any richer, but it does make me angrier about the way this company treats its customers. I will now stop using Aveeno altogether and tell everyone I know to boycott it.",RFV3252XGROGQ,1.0,The worst moisturizer with cream and oil all separated,1.0,459.0,AEMZWCIGXXMNXWVY3CSE2XSTPMZA,1,0,63277988,0,0,[False]

No gripes about the product itself as the butter was super moisturizing, had a great creamy texture and whipped up very quickly.

[False],1,B01CCD0MLO,"Hemp seed oil can have many uses in the essential oil world, but you do have to be sure you get either ingestible or non-ingestible. This variety is non-ingestible. You can use this on your skin with no problems though. I would test a small area of your skin to be sure you do not have any reactions to it. You will get this in a dark brown bottle with dropper. The dark brown is for storage, it keeps the light out and the oil lasting longer. This is shelf stable but do not keep near heat. The dropper itself works good too! The oil has an earthy almost nutty scent that is quite lovely. It kind of smells clean too. No chemically smell at all! I actually got this to make soaps, but I haven't done that yet. When I do, I will post it in the comments section. I did get this also for acne prone skin. My youngest is suffering from it and although the products she is using now have been more effective than most in the past, I have heard that hemp seed oil is great for clearing up whiteheads and blackheads because it actually deep cleans pores. And all this without drying your skin out. So far so good for the days she has been using it. We do still use her regular regime in the morning, and this at night. She simply puts a couple of drops onto a cotton ball and wipes it across her forehead, the spot she gets it as most. No redness or drying. She actually likes the smell of the hemp seed oil too. So far, only one blackhead seemed to ""emerge"". It was a big one on the side of her forehead by the scalp area so it may have just been ready, but I think this helped along a little faster. We will continue to use this nightly. It is also great as a carrier oil too. Hemp Seed oil mixes nicely with rosemary and lemongrass to make a soothing earthly blend that is quite pleasant and uplifting. I am by far an expert, but I am learning and hemp seed oil is one I am really new with, only hearing what my friends have done and what I have done so far. I did get this at a discounted sale price. I am leaving my honest review of this product and am in no way compensated by the company for it. Because I am new to essential oils and oils in general, what I review are my opinions.

[False],7,B001F51TBI,"Dear Proctor & Gamble As a man, it‚Äôs difficult complaining about a product that‚Äôs marketed to women. Twenty five years ago, give or take, I started using ‚ÄòOil of Ulay‚Äô moisturiser. I admit to ‚Äòmanning it up‚Äô and referring to it as ‚ÄòOil of Ugly‚Äô but it got the job done. I even made some suggestions about marketing it to men, all those years ago (see picture attached) but recently have come the changes‚Ä¶ Ok, I know marketing, so I can understand the need to align the brand across different markets, and I get the change to ‚ÄòOlay‚Äô but it didn‚Äôt stop with just the name. Next, we had a plethora of new, brand-stretching product ranges that confused what had previously been a straightforward choice. Again, I get that but it didn‚Äôt do much for the brand integrity to have shelves cluttered to the point where the customer needed to double, triple check the product to make sure that they got what they wanted. Perpetual changes of packaging and range names didn‚Äôt help much either. So, having double, triple checked the packaging on the shelf, and having been convinced that ‚ÄòOlay - Essentials - Beauty Fluid - Sensitive - Day Fluid‚Äô was, in fact, the same product that I‚Äôd been buying for a quarter of a century, I wasn‚Äôt anticipating a complete revamp of the product‚Äôs constituent ingredients. I tried the new product for a week, by which time my rapidly aging visage had morphed, lizard-like, into Reptile Man. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt working‚Äù, I told the Proctor & Gamble customer relations lady over the telephone. ‚ÄúWhat have you done to Olay?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, there‚Äôs been a small change but I will send you a voucher so that you can try one of our other products‚Ä¶‚Äù Let‚Äôs give it a chance, I thought. The voucher arrived and, on my next visit to the supermarket, I scanned the shelf to see what else might get the job done. Having read the marketing blurb on a dozen different but similarly branded products, I took the plunge with ‚ÄòOlay - Anti-Wrinkle - SPF15 - Firm & Lift - Day Lotion‚Äô. A quick comparison with a dot in the palm of my hand of the old product, the replacement product, and my new replacement product, demonstrated that the new products had a synthetic look and feel to them that, on application, didn‚Äôt seem to penetrate my skin anything like as efficiently as the ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô. There didn‚Äôt appear to be any difference in the ‚Äònew‚Äô and ‚Äònew, new‚Äô products other than consistency. One was more concentrated than the other. Worse still, after two weeks‚Äô use, the ‚Äònew, new‚Äô product didn‚Äôt seem to perform any better. So, am I to try yet more products at my own expense? Now, I don‚Äôt know about you but I don‚Äôt have the time or the money to do back to back, long term tests of moisturiser products just to get back to a situation where I had previously had an answer and besides, in the meantime, I have to put up with not looking, and therefore not feeling, my best. I cannot yet vouch for any new found ability to grow back my tail. Here we have a well established product, whose brand is now stretched to the point of confusing the customer, and the manufacturer decides that it would be a good idea to make wholesale changes to the product itself. Now, this might come as a surprise to the bright young things involved in product positioning but any marketing man, or woman, particularly if they‚Äôre old enough to be lizard-like and scaly, will tell you that brand loyalty is the crown jewels of any product in any category. You mess with brand loyalty at your peril. As things stand, your competitors could not have done a better job of sinking the Olay brand flagship if they had stalked it in a U-boat wolf pack and delivered all of their torpedoes across its beam. Whilst Proctor and Gamble undoubtedly has the corporate clout to establish its credentials in the community with a network of Reptile Rescue Centres with free, over the counter moisturising samples in plain packaging, I would prefer to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible. I don‚Äôt have a problem with growing old gracefully but I do want to have the option of shedding my skin in the comfort of my own vivarium and at a time of my choice. I understand that I will now have to put up with the consequences of having to shop around to find a replacement moisturising product but, at the very least, I think you owe your customers an explanation and then, just maybe, an admission that you got this very, very wrong.",R1KH9SE3LCRO17,1.0,"Proctor & Gamble,  you got this wrong...",1.0,823.0,AEZT34VJGHVDNJPEXX4MUDFE2KDA,1,0,52940291,0,0,[False]

I would rate it 6 stars if I could... but then I check the ingredients, and this is where it gets problematic. As a daily sunscreen user to help prevent/slow aging and risk of melanoma when I read the ingredients I hesitate: Avobenzone (3%) degrades when it is exposed to the sun which results in harmful free radicals being released into the body, which can accelerate the aging process and increase the risk of illness including cancer. Avobenzone only has about a 30 minute sun exposure because of the way it rapidly degraded. It is also harmful to reefs. Homosalate (8%) Once the ingredient has been absorbed, homosalate accumulates in our bodies faster than the body can get rid of it, becomes toxic and disrupts hormones. Also damaging to reefs. Octinoxate (4.5%) The EWG rates octinoxate a six, which is a moderate hazard. It can lead to developmental and reproductive toxicity. Octinoxate is a hormone disruptor.

[False],0,B07G14PWZN,"I have been using Rosehip oil for several years now and have always liked the way it has helped keep my skin soft and basically wrinkle free. When I ran out of my last bottle, not Cliganic, I could no longer find it. So Amazon to the rescue. I found this site and liked the reviews so I decided to try it. I am glad I took the chance. It is organic and has no other oil in it as do other Rosehip oils that I've seen. I use it twice a day, in the morning, after washing my face with a soft brush and mild cleansing foam. after drying, I use a small amount, one drop on the four points of my face then gently massage it into my skin. I use a couple of drops on neck, smoothing it over. I also use it before bedtime, going through the same routine; washing my face of the grit and grim of the day with the foam cleanser. I have learned to give myself a good facial massage over the years and having a good cream or oil is always best. while it has help to keep the dryness away, I've always had a problem with dark spots or Melasma on my cheeks and nose. Makeup only enhanced the dark spots and I don't like using heavy makeup. So the Rose hip oil I used, the old one, did help but only just a little, keeping the Melasma at bay. When I began using this brand, a week after using this oil, I noticed that my skin was lighter around the area of my Melasma. It's been a month since I have been using this oil and my Melasma is almost completely gone. My skin is smoother and at 65, that is an great accomplishment for me.  It is not greasy at all and massaging it into my neck and face has kept the wrinkles away, best of all once its been massaged into the skin there is no oily residue. I have also used this oil at least once a month on my scalp to help get rid of the shampoo and conditioner build up. I massage into my scalp and allow it to rest for about 10 minutes before shampooing and conditioning. Because I've don't this for several years now, I don't have a problem with thinning hair and my scalp is healthier and I have not had a case of dandruff in several years now. Also when I run out of my Aragon oil which I use for dry ends, I use one drop in my palm, spread it then run my hands through the ends, which also helps.

My third tub, I opened a week ago, but it's packed full of tiny lumps of maybe the cocoa butter, and smells really nasty. Bleh. It's hard to use. since it reeks so bad, I just use in on my feet and use socks to help with the restless leg syndrome. However, those massive amounts of lumps make it hard to get rubbed in and they end up all over the rug and floor. And the smell... At $25 a jar, I expect it to not be like this. I took one star away because of this most recent tub. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Edit- I didn't plan on buying anymore of this cream, but it helps so much with my old lady hip pain, that I did buy more! Now, I keep this in both bathrooms, so when my husband is on the night shifts in his working rotation, I can still use it without trying to sneak by him.  I just don't use it down my legs if I'm not wearing sweats, since the shea butter gives that sticky feeling. If I'm using this cream, there is no pain! ------------ This works pretty good. I find that if I use it every evening after my shower, I forget that it's working and I won't use it for a few days, an will have leg pain again.  However, the shea butter is a mess. While the weather is still cool / cold and I'm still wearing sweats, this is OK, but one it warms up, there will be no way to use this cream while wearing shorts. This cream doesn't absorb in, and will make a oily mess on furniture. Also, it's so 'there' even after being on my legs under sweats by the time I got to bed, that I stick to the sheets. I'm not fond of that feeling. On the nights I use this, I end up tossing and turning quit a bit because of being so sticky. Because of this, I'll be looking for a different magnesium remedy to try.

I use it for making lip balm, face cream and deodorant (if you have never made your own deodorant you should; it's amazing!!!).

I personally like the scent of the unrefined version, especially as I know it has more nutrients than the refined, but not everyone does. I find it slightly nutty, and combined with essential oils in the body products I make it is pleasant to me. However, it's not to the liking of all, so go with the refined version if you want a blank palette to work with, with no fragrance. For facial cream it goes on slightly greasy but is absorbed very quickly and leaves only a slight healthy radiance once rubbed in. I do have dry skin though. My husband, however, has more oily skin and uses it every day without any increase in grease so I would say it works in a cream for all skin types. It is all he uses now; he loves it. It's a bit thick in my opinion for your hands or body, but I have but a dab on the back of my hands when extremely dry and it works nearly instantly to moisturize.

[False],4,B075GWQMP6,"This little scrubber has been great for helping get rid of some of my clogged pores around my nose. This scrubber helps cleanse my skin when I seem to occasionally get a bunch of closed comedones on my nose. After using this scrubber I can always feel that my skin is a little smoother and it helped unclog some of my pores. Typically, I don't get blackheads which is the intended use for this scrubber, but it definitely helps with closed comedones which is the cousin to the blackhead. There doesn't seem to be any directions included, but from Googling this product and reading other reviews this is what you need to do: 1. When you first get your Tako you need to break it in. It will feel too smooth to start so you need to rub it on your cheeks or forearm for a minute to bring out some of the exfoliating grits. 2. While your face is wet, rub the Tako in circular motions over your problem areas. Your skin might not turn gray, but the Tako is still working. 3. I usually let the solution sit on my face for a minute, then I wash it off and feel my smoother skin. This has been a life-saver for getting rid of some of my closed-comedones.

I can't tell you how shocked I was by this as I've tried many different lotions for very dry skin over the years and none of them have done for my skin what Aveeno skin relief has!

It actually caused my skin to feel like it was burning and was very uncomfortable. Sometimes switching skin care can briefly irritated the face so I decided to keep using it to see if it eventually got better. Sadly it didn't.

[False],6,B000PIMUR8,"Let me just start out this stuff is pretty much the most essential product you can buy if you want healthy, acne free skin.  I am a 26 year old male who has had acne prone skin since I was middle school.  My acne has never been severe, I think the worst was when I was in middle school, but that was a looong time ago.  My acne usually occurs near my jawline and right under it.  Sometimes I get these painful cysts that are absolutely impossible to clear up.  So I was pretty much getting sick of getting these sporadic acne blemishes and cysts, so I had done some research and heard witch hazel was a key ingredient in helping diminish acne.  Somehow I stumbled into Thayer Lavender Witch Hazel and saw the raving reviews about it and decided why not, might as well give it a shot, it's cheap (in cost), and has NO alcohol.  So I went to the local GNC, because that was the only place I could find this product. After purchasing this product, I have two words...GAME-CHANGER. Now let me tell you, it doesn't work immediately. Give it a week or so and you will see improvement on your skin, so don't get discouraged that it doesn't work immediately. I kid you not, this product is the BEST for acne prone skin. Now I know everybody has different type of skin, so everybody has a different regiment when cleansing their skin. But this is what I do. I still use a bacteria cleanser beforehand and then use a thin layer of acne moisturizer (non-oil) and then follow up with the Thayer Lavendar Witch Hazel.  I usually just pour a decent splash on my hand, you can never have too much! And then just rub it all over my face from my forehead all the way to my neck. Another great product I use once a week is the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Bentonite Clay (i splash a little of the Thayers in the mix).  It's been a month or few weeks since I first used this product and my skin has improved dramatically.  The best part is that you can use this product as often as possible.

The paste is liquid tinted but as you spread it, it whitens and i feel like it is noticeable on my face by the whiteness but i guess that depends on how much i put. I like that there is no shine. The product i believe is water resistant cause it definitely does not wash off with water, i have to use face wash and a face scrubber to clean my face after using this. I just hope it does not end up breaking my face out. So i plan to update. Update: seems like it is working good after about a week of using it. The whiteness though i pretty white on my face even with a little. When i do wipe off this product it shows the tinted color. Update: not working for me too much of a white cast and i would have to buy an oil cleanser in order to get this off.

[False],3,B005I2MP62,"(( Warning:  This is really long, clearly I'm not well versed in the ways of writing to-the-point reviews!  Sorry about that.)) This is the first time I've written a review for a skin product, despite how many different kinds I've tried over the past year.  I'll start with an explanation of what I've been experiencing with my skin, in hopes that anyone going through a similar situation may find this helpful!  For starters, I'm a woman in my 20's, and just this past summer I started breaking out with what I'm guessing is hormonal cystic acne; it's been awful!  I've always had a bit of acne since my teen years, it never really cleared up entirely, but something just set it off and it's been at its worst for almost a year now.  My worst area has to be my cheeks, where I've gotten large cystic welts that sting all day.  I've tried *many* products from various brands, from drugstore cheap-o's to $50-per-ounce fancy ones.  Most products didn't have much of an effect.  The only time I did see a change in my skin was when I tried Proactiv+, and that change came in the form of a horribly painful, throbbing chemical burn that turned my whole face beet red.  I have sensitive skin on top of my acne problems, so let it be known that I was using the Proactiv+ routine sparingly only once daily rather than twice, and only used the exfoliation scrub once a week for 3 1/2 months with no positive outcome. After my bad experience with Proactiv+, as well as finding that other BP and SA products weren't doing much for me, I decided to give some of the natural ingredient products a try in hopes of avoiding further chemical burns.  I started seeing a significant improvement after picking up some products from Trader Joe's (I'll list them below), but I wasn't having much luck with calming down the redness caused by my acne/scars, nor was my rough forehead looking any better; not to mention, the healing areas on my face were peeling and pretty bothersome to deal with.  Again, with sensitive skin, I was wary of touching anything with scrubbing beads after what Proactiv+ did. By chance, I came across this product at the local grocery store.  I hadn't tried anything by RoC, and was in need of something that would exfoliate the dead skin from my face while still being gentle.  Long story long, this product has been a Godsend!  I've been using it for a few weeks, and in combination with the rest of my routine, my skin has become so smooth and soft; my forehead is almost entirely cleared up and is smoother than it's ever been, the redness has been significantly reigned in, and on top of all that, the lines that were starting to form near my eyes and over my brows are gone!  The jar is appropriately colored, because this stuff is like gold to me! Now then, for those who are in the same boat and would like to see the routine that's been working for me, here it is! Step 1:  Drink lots of water!  I know you probably keep hearing this, but it's true!  I've always been bad with this one, but so long as I keep a bottle nearby and force myself to take several hearty chugs every hour or so, it makes a huge difference! - Morning Routine - Soak a rag in warm water (not too hot, no need to burn your face off), lay it over your face to open up your pores - Use a RoC resurfacing disk; *gently* massage the soft side over your whole face, get a nice, lathery foam started.  Turn the disk over and use the textured side on your forehead (this is where the magic comes from!) or any other areas where your skin my be rougher.  The key is to be gentle!  Tearing up your skin will only lead to more problems, you're not aiming to rip stuff from your skin. - Rinse the foam away gently with cool/cold water; this will close up your pores, and I've noticed it also reduces any redness.  It's also a good way to boost your alertness in the morning! - Next, I take a round cotton pad, dip it under the faucet to get it damp, then pour some 100% Witch Hazel (any brand will do, just make sure it's 100%), not much, just a little squirt, then I add just a drop of 100% pure Tea Tree Oil from Trader Joe's (comes in a tiny glass bottle).  This combination acts as a toner (Witch Hazel) as well as a natural way to fight acne (Tea Tree Oil).  Gently stroke the pad over your whole face, even in areas where you don't have any acne present.  I love the smell of these products, I find it soothing, and you'll also feel a bit of a tingle; for some, the Tea Tree Oil may feel like it's burning a bit, I have very sensitive skin, so that's why it's a good idea to just use one drop of it.  You can also just use the Witch Hazel, but I really have seen a change since I added Tea Tree Oil. - Once that has dried (your skin may feel a bit stiff, no worries), I mix 2-3 drops of Jojoba Oil (Trader Joe's) with a quarter-size amount of Dermalogica's Ultracalming Serum Concentrate; this is one of those high-priced products that I picked up over the course of my search for a routine that would work for me, and it's one of the few moisturizing products that didn't make my skin burn!  As for the Jojoba Oil, you may want to start slowly with this stuff; I've read that its trick is that it's very similar to the natural sebum that your skin produces, or in the case of acne-prone skin, over-produces, which leads to clogged up pores and so on.  Jojoba Oil may not be right for everyone, and your skin may need some time to adjust to it like mine did, but now I use it twice daily and I love it! - Once more, allow the products a few minutes to dry.  Next, I'll use either Trader Joe's Nourish Oil-free Antioxidant face moisturizer, or their Enrich SPF moisturizer depending on whether or not I think I'll be getting some sun that day. This probably seems like a lot to do... and it kind of is.  With the state that my skin has been in, though, I'm just at the point where I'm willing to do anything to get past this.  For the ladies who wear makeup, this routine will make your skin a bit shiny (thanks to the various oils and moisturizers), so a pressed-powder or matte foundation may be desired; also, be sure you let everything dry before you even lift your beauty blender!  Also, if throughout the day you're able to, you can take a damp cotton pad with some Witch Hazel to lightly soak up any oily problem areas, as well as calm some of the redness that may develop.  You may want to apply some more moisturizer after doing so. -Night Routine - Same routine as above, but instead of using the RoC resurfacing disk, I usually just rinse my face in the shower with warm water, followed by a quick splash of cold to close up my pores before getting out and starting with the Witch Hazel / Tea Tree Oil step.  Oh, and a random note: when stepping out of the shower, don't scrub your face dry with your towel, just gently pat it dry (or even allow it to air dry).  If you need to wash off makeup, however, then I like to use Trader Joe's Facial Cleansing Oil with Argan and Coconut Oil.  It smells awesome and feels warm on the skin, just be sure that you rinse it off thoroughly! Alright, that's everything.  I don't think I can give a tl;dr version... but I hope this helps someone who's going through anything similar.

Somehow, and again I have no idea how this works, this spray immediately stops the itch and pain. The rash is still visible until my tablets kick in, but all the discomfort disappears IMMEDIATELY, as soon as the spray touches my skin it cools down, stops itching and burning, and feels less tight. It's just unbelievable. I also use it on my face and I rarely get red/pink patches any more. It feels divine to spray it on your face after a work out as well. I couldn't recommend this product any more to anyone with skin problems like mine. It's not a cure, but it holds the worst of my symptoms at bay until proper medicine can kick in and it has made my mornings so much more enjoyable (and bearable).

That‚Äôs the issue in this hole grooming industry right now. Even though this has a great guy scent, I don‚Äôt need it.

In the description it claims that this lotion doesn‚Äôt leave you feeling greasy. That is a false claim. In fact, I would say this is greasier than some of the others I‚Äôve used. It‚Äôs basically counterproductive if I use it on my hands because I end up having to wash it off of my palms afterwards. -is it absorbing? Either a lot goes a little ways or it‚Äôs not absorbing into my skin. I‚Äôve already use this to moisturize my tattoo AND against a sunburn.

[False],161,B004Z209HS,"I was raised to always take care of my skin; but as I've gotten older, I've become a bit more zealous in keeping it hydrated and healthy. At the same time, I'm also more conscientious now about using more natural products. I'll admit to being a bit skeptical at first when I began hearing all the talk of argan oil. Certainly as a younger woman, I'd avoided putting any ""oil"" on my face for fear of breakouts; but even at my age now, old habits die hard, and I was a bit reluctant to start. Finally decided to try it, though. At first, I just pumped several drops to try out on neck and the backs of my hands after drying off after a shower. Then I started putting it on areas of my face that have never broken out (do I sound like a scaredy-cat, or what?). All still good. This argan oil glides on silkily, not slippery or greasy like some oils. When I first apply the oil, there is a definite oil sheen to my skin. Worried me the first time...but it just absorbs in a couple of minutes and I'm left with soft, protected skin. My biggest surprise was that it seems to maybe have a bit of a healing property to it. I have normal skin that can get a bit dry during the indoor-heat of winter; but, while I am definitely well past the age of regular skin breakouts, every few months or so, I end up with a small blemish on my nose or chin (the only areas of my face that ever tend to be oily). I was really leery of putting the argan oil on these areas. I mean, really, just asking for trouble, right? But, after reading a couple of reviewers say that it cleared up blemishes for them, I tried it on a small blemish that had popped up on the side of my nose. I had been dabbing a Q-tip with an alcohol-based drier on the blemish to make it go away which had the nasty side-effect of making the skin around the blemish dry and flaky. Nothing like calling extra attention to the bump on your nose. Oddly enough, after I finally ""braved"" putting the oil on the blemish, the redness went away and the spot was gone in a day or two. Weird...not sure what that's all about. I think my favorite way of using argan oil is in my hair. The amount you use should probably be adjusted depending on whether or not you have dry or normal hair and the length of your hair. My hair is normal and about chin length. I rub a couple drops of the oil between my palms and then work it through my hair when it is nearly dry and then finish drying and styling. Just my way of doing it...you can also add to still wet hair. In my hair, it adds shine and conditioning without leaving my hair looking oily. It also does a good job of separating the waves and curls in my hair. The smell of the oil is pleasant...very mild with a faint scent that reminds me of something herbal. After checking into what the ""scent"" is, I found that it is just the faint residual smell from the tea tree oil that they use to disinfect their equipment. Still smells nice, though. Although I like the product and am finding a number of uses for it, I'm finding that the argan oil is still not a sufficient replacement for the more emollient-rich night creams that I've been using. With my older skin, it just feels like they remain on my skin longer. Instead I put on a small amount of the Pura D'or argan oil before heading outside for my morning exercise (also good for chapped lips). I see that Pura D'or also has an organic Anti-Aging Face Cream available on Amazon (with strong reviews). This cream may have the more emollient, moisturizing feel that I'm looking for. At $89, I'll probably need to wait until I see it available for a lower price before I try it out, though. A sample bottle of Pura D'or argan oil was provided to me for reviewing purposes.",R1CF1ZKP23KH0D,3.0,I was skeptical at first...but am now finding some uses for this Argan Oil,4.1,303.6,AHO2ZKVTDPL6G35FLZW7UGXCYSEA,663,524,3665,85,59,[False]

[True],2,B004Z209HS,"I love this oil.  So far it has been a godsend for my skin and my hair.  I'm very happy with the fact that this Argan oil is cold-pressed and unrefined.  Using a cold-pressing process instead of heat ensure that the Argan oil's natural moisturizing and soothing properties stay intact, and preserves the high content of anti aging antioxidants.  This oil has no noticeable fragrance, and absorbs fairly quickly into skin. I have used this Argan oil on areas of my skin that were slightly sunburned, after reading about the healing properties of the oil, and it significantly cut down on peeling and dryness in those areas.  I have also used this oil on my hair, and I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone with dry, brittle, or frizz-prone hair!  I live in Florida and have very fine, curly hair that is pretty unmanageable most of the time here due to the humidity, but using Argan oil has helped a LOT.  I usually smooth a small, dime sized amount through my towel-dried hair, from roots to tips (I have hair that goes a few inches down past my shoulders, so those with shorter or longer hair may need to adjust the amount of Argan oil used).  A little bit goes a long way, which is one of my favorite traits of this fantastic oil. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I will not rate items highly if they don't deserve the rating, and I write these lengthy reviews to help out fellow shoppers, since I always read reviews on products before buying.

[False],0,B004Z209HS,"Premium quality product, good price. 100% organic argan oil. Very useful for skin, hair. Love it. The triterpenoids naturally found in Argan oil offer amazing health benefits for skin including the ability to stunt the growth of warts, treat some forms of dermatitis, break down tumorous skin cells, and fade scars. Also, the antioxidants and fatty acids found in Argan oil may also help with the treatment of mild acne and with the healing of acne-related scarring. Argan oil is comprised of roughly 80% fatty acids which work wonders to erase signs of premature aging. Regular use of Argan oil has been proven to reduce the depth and severity of wrinkles, as well as to fade age spots by restoring skin‚Äôs youthful elasticity and by increasing the regenerative rate of healthy skin cells. Even for those who don‚Äôt have scarring, wrinkles, or some other skin ailment, Argan oil can still make your skin soft and supple. Saponins in Argan oil reactivate skin cells‚Äô ability to regenerate, keeping your largest and most important bodily organ healthy and strong. While there are many cheaper Argan oil ‚Äòcocktails‚Äô available in the health and beauty market which may have severely lessened benefits to your health, 100% pure Argan oil truly is a miracle oil to add to your natural remedy collection.

[False],0,B00WXVLZQW,I wanted to like this soap. I really did I fell for the good funny marketing and was using Irish Spring body wash before and I just felt like it was bad for me. I ordered the Cedar Citrus assuming it would have a more Citrus scent and it smelled good out of the box. After using it my skin felt dry and the smell didn‚Äôt last too long honestly. I thought to myself maybe bar soap is just like that because I noticed most bar soaps tend to make your skin a little more dry. This strips your skin of its natural moisture and doesn‚Äôt add any moisture back to your skin. If you get this bar and just rub it on your body (as seen in the ads) you won‚Äôt get that much of a lather and is probably one of the reasons people say it doesn‚Äôt last long. You keep scrubbing until it finally lathers and before you notice most of it can disappear quick. I use a loofa and I will admit it lathers a lot when paired with a loofa. They‚Äôre not lying when it comes it lather. I even used the Pine Tar scent which I felt lasted a bit longer and had a better scent but it still left my skin feeling dry. For the price I honestly wouldn‚Äôt purchase again due to the fact that the smell doesn‚Äôt last very long and that dry feeling you get after you shower.

I believe this is due to the zinc. However, there's 2 things I don't like about this product. 1) It advertises having ""invisible zinc"" technology but it definitely would leave a cast on darker skin tones. I personally apply 5 pumps in total for my face a neck to make sure I'm definitely getting the sun protection. 2) This is TERRIBLE for reapplication.

Also, as for all the negative reviews saying it‚Äôs ‚Äústicky‚Äù or ‚Äúuneven‚Äù just simply READ the instructions clearly listed on the packaging that say not to be active or get it wet while developing, it literally says to be ready to sit and read a book or watch a movie and just chill while it develops.

First stepÔºöGet the cloth wet with warm water Second stepÔºö Rub some face wash all over my face Third stepÔºöUse the cloth to wipe away the face wash and makeup from your face. It's incredible how easy it comes off! I go once or twice around my whole face and eyes and you're done! I just rinse it out and go over my eyes again if I wear mascara. If my eye makeup is being extra stubborn I just put a few drops of makeup remover directly on the cloth and rub my eyes with it to get out every last speck. But that's not very frequent. It just depends on how much, what kind and how strong your eye makeup is that day. Either way, it never bothers your eyes because it's so soft. If you wear any kind of makeup I highly recommend these, I'm extremely happy with them and might get some for gifts. They wash extremely well in the laundry too.

So this morning when I woke up with last nights makeup still on I was dreading the rubbing of the eyes to get off the smudge proof eye liner and 16 hour lipstick. I was skeptical about how well this cloth was going to work as I got it wet. Then I rubbed it gently over my eye lid and there went most of the eye liner. WHAT?! How could this be, what witch craft is this? It had to be a fluke, how does it even work? So the next test was the lipstick, that requires a special gel to help you get it off. I took the cloth and rubbed my lips, it was coming off, slowly but surely it was coming off. Then I thought, well maybe if I use the gel first, so I put on the gel and wet the cloth and swiped it over my lips. The lipstick was gone! This lipstick never comes off easy even with the gel!

[False],1,B07Q567YPY,"I've been looking at more ways to reduce my waste, plastic use ect and thought this would be a good choice for both purposes. I used the cloth straight out of the bag without reading instructions, so hindsight... Yea, should probably way before using as instructed. Just got a bit of lint fuzziest on my face but no big deal. A nice rinse and dry, probably just a rinse would be fine before using would be advisable. Using on heavy makeup, glitter, eyeliner, the works, I found this product gentle but effective using only water. I have some micellar water that really stings my eyes so was glad I needed no additional cleanser to  shed the day's glam look. Just followed it up with some moisturizer and my face felt really great. I can't really speak as yet to the ease of washing, I'm sure a bit of staining will happen but I'm planning on just hand washing with a bit of Dawn dish soap. I think that'll be better for my sensitive face skin than detergent used in the washing machine. Maybe a little cumbersome for some but I personally enjoy the size of the cloth. Pretty big, only need maybe 1/8 of it, both sides, to clean my entire face (hi! Less washing!). Couple that with the number of cloths included in the price I'm a happy customer. Soft, gentle on the eye area, effective with just water and Eco friendly. It feels silly to have been using single use wipes for so long! * Full disclosure / bonus!

[False],0,B0013A6NFM,"I've heard very good things about this brand, and was excited to try this cleanser. I'm at the nuisance age of enjoying periodic acne along with mild wrinkles, so I keep looking for solutions for the former that don't exacerbate the latter (dry skin makes the wrinkles look worse, for those not yet familiar with the pattern). This cleanser is not going to stay in my arsenal. Pros: 1. Only need to use a small amount, which should make the very small bottle last longer 2. Rinses clean, without residue 3. Doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin 4. Doesn't seem to strip my skin, but leaves it feeling clean 5. Doesn't dry my skin to make the wrinkles look worse Cons: 1. Doesn't do much other than clean. I didn't notice any effect other than the mental one from the ""cooling action"" of the menthol. I got zero benefit from using this other than the ""cleansing"" part. 2. Not suitable for removing makeup. This is definitely a cleanser to be used strictly for a makeup-free face. Even when I used it after removing my makeup (with Neutrogena wipes, which are the best I've found so far), I still needed another cleanser for traces of eye makeup since I'm not putting menthol around my eyes. 3. Doesn't foam. It's more of a watery gel, like inexpensive liquid hand soap. That means it's also kind of runny, so applying it in the shower meant it ran into my eyes if I wasn't careful. Note that this is only because I let it sit on my skin for several seconds to try to get some benefit from the salicylic acid. This approach is NOT suggested on the packaging, so I can't fault Obagi for it. I do wish it had a thicker consistency, though, so the salicylic acid could sit and have time to do something. 4. Expensive. Considering the tiny bottle size and minimal effects (and the need for something else to remove makeup), the price tag seems very high. I've used drug store cleansers that were on par with this one for a fraction of the cost. If I'm spending more, I'd rather invest in Algenist or La Mer cleansers, which don't claim to do anything for acne, but do clean my skin beautifully (including eye makeup).

There Is a huge difference between the qualities of oils. This is a Grade A oil, it is so amazing! I am always resistant to try new things, especially oils. I was looking for a light oil for my hair, and skin. This was the best, and perfect oil. This oil is weightless, and has a greet scent. Because it is not so heavy I can use it on my hair to add shine, and moisture, without weighing my hair down. Incorporating this oil into my haircare regimen has made a huge difference in the health of my hair. I have a head full of curls, and after I apply leave in conditioner, I apply this moisturizing oil! My hair has been growing super fast, and maintaining a natural luster. I even a pply this to my brows, and there is a noticable change in thinkness. As far as my skin, this oil is a God send!

This results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination. Free radicals are known to induce indirect DNA DAMAGE and an increased concentration of free radicals might have contributed to the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in sunscreen-users compared to non-users."" This is from a peer-reviewed, science journal. The other active ingredient, avobenzone, easily penetrates the skin and is a strong free radical generator as well. The whole purpose of sunscreen is to protect you from damage, not CAUSE it. A much safer option is a sunblock - zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. They are photostable when exposed to radiation-aka sun rays and scatter the light rather than absorb it. They also protect BOTH kinds of harmful sun rays(UVA and UVB).

Physical exfoliation followed by good lotions helped only a little.  Recently I heard about glycolic acid and found this product on Amazon.  When I first tried it, the lotion was so thick, I could hardly get it to flow through the pump.  So for a little while, I'd open the bottle and take some off the stem of the pump.  It was kind of a hassle, so I only used it on my feet, which were VERY dry and rough.  It worked amazingly well on my feet; pedicures are no longer embarrassing, and I can reveal my feet in sandals anytime I want.  So I started using it more often on my body.  The first few times it stung a little and itched, but I got used to it and it no longer bothers me at all.  Now I've been using it every 3-4 days, and it has performed miracles.  The backs of my arms have never felt so soft and smooth!  And my legs are coming along very nicely (they were worse).  I plan to use it daily now.  I think once I've gotten my skin to how I want it, I'll probably only need to use it every other day.  All I know is I thought I'd never be able to get rid of my embarrassing bumps, but miracles do happen.  I only wish I'd had this when I was young and fit and wearing bikinis!  Now I'm retired and no longer as fit and trim, but I'm still very happy to have my skin looking and feeling so much better.  I'm no longer embarrassed to be seen in tank tops.  This lotion has worked so well, I'm going to check out the facial version.  If it works anything like the body lotion, I'll probably be looking 10 years younger soon.

[False],3,B01FGV958A,"So I'll start off by saying that I have eczema. Bad eczema. It's pretty terrible year round, but it ramps up to 11+ during the summer. Heat + humidity + friction from my clothes = a bright red disaster by August. I use tons of creams and soaps to manage it, including other soaps from Southern Natural, but after showering or applying creams, I run into the problem of having too much moisture on my skin (which causes itching) or too little moisture (which makes my skin feel super tight, promotes even more itching, and then causes it to blister and break). When the chance to try Southern Natural's new Dead Sea Mud Bamboo Charcoal Soap came up, I jumped at the opportunity. I actually started buying from SN about two years ago at Birmingham's Pepper Place Market. My go-to soap had been the Castille and Unscented goat milk soaps, but they never quite reached the HG (Holy Grail) soap status. And at this point, with the temperature outside being 87 degrees and feeling like 110 with the humidity (leaving me a red, angry, itching mess), I was desperate to try anything. Day 1: Could smell the soap through the box. Minty, like gum. My husband was sure I had purchased some kind of ridiculous Prime deal that consisted of all the mint gums in the world. Nope. Just the soap. At this point, I'm hoping it's not so fragranced that I can't use it, because of the holy trifecta of allergies, eczema, and asthma, I somehow scored two of the three. Two bars of soap arrived, and the package came with the seriously life changing soap sock. I would have purchased for the soap sock alone, to be honest. Never have my bars of soap lasted so long. Like when you wash with most charcoal soaps, you're going to have one of two thoughts: 1) ""Holy cow, I'm dirty!"" or 2) ""What the heck? Why is the bottom of my tub gray?"" No difference from other charcoal soaps here. Gray suds, gray soap--to be expected. The soap lathered nicely, even with my terrible hard water. The smell wasn't as overpowering as I thought; a byproduct of heat exposure while shipping, I suppose. Only the faintest hint of mint remained once the soap hit the water, like a gentle whiff of peppermint oil. Once out of the shower, though, I noticed that my skin didn't feel as moisturized as I had hoped. It seemed dry, tight, like I had washed by body with dishwashing soap. A little discouraged, but reminding myself that skin takes a few days to get used to new products, I slathered on some cream and agreed to try again with tomorrow's shower. Day 2: Showered again (obviously, as who would admit to not showering on Amazon, of all places?) Gray soap, gray water, same light mint smell, same rich lather. Wash up, step out, pat dry. Notice a difference. Yesterday my skin felt like a stretched piece of dry, cracking leather. Today, it feels... softer. Smoother. Dare I say, moisturized? By this point, I've already decided that I'm doing a full week test on this soap. You know, for science. Day 3: Same shower, different day. Post physical therapy, so we're going to see how this bad boy helps with irritated, dirty skin. As I'm showering, I'm surprised by the feel of my skin. The irritation that left me scratching has calmed down. I'm no longer a tomato. My skin has started to peel, but I think that's a good thing with all the exfoliation from the soap sock. Days 4-7: Shower, shower, shower, shower. This is the longest I've ever gone without creams or moisturizers. My skin is no longer tight or peeling. In fact, my skin is actually softer. My husband has started stealing the soap. He hates wearing lotions, but the soap has left his skin moisturized without sticky creams as well. Writing this post-day 7 shower and my skin is like velvet. I'm still wondering if I can get this soap by the pound (or even by the ton) so I never run out. Overall impression: Fantastic soap. Seriously. With the addition of the soap sock, this is so close to being my HG soap. If it made my eczema go away and never return, it would be my HG for sure, but I know with my skin, only medicated creams make it go away for good. Love the scent--soothing peppermint, which definitely made the bathroom smell fantastic and helped to calm my redness. I'm nowhere close to finishing this bar, but once I do, I'm immediately slipping in the second bar!

[False],1,B00L5O4Q32,"Some background: I have mild acne, and get a new pimple every few days. I‚Äôve been using the whole clear extra strength system for only around 2 weeks now, but I‚Äôve been using a BHA exfoliant for about a year now. My acne has left dark marks and red marks, but it all fades over time. I have clogged pores focused mostly on my nose, the tops of my cheeks, and a bit on my forehead and chin. None of it is terribly noticeable except from very close up, but I‚Äôve found Paula‚Äôs products have, for the most part, been making great improvements in my skin. That being said, not all of her products work and you can‚Äôt just take her word for it on a lot of her products because many of them, especially some of the newer releases, are a bit gimmicky in how their being sold. I have small clogged pores along my forehead, and I often find myself mechanically clearing them out even though that is obviously such a terrible idea. Sometimes that irritates my pores and I have these terrible, deep pimples that take forever to come to a head. That being said, this product is so good at keeping my pimples at bay. For pimples that you can just feel forming, this has the potential to get rid of them in one night. For larger pimples, that definitely won‚Äôt happen, but this will reduce their size dramatically, and if you want major results, I‚Äôve noticed I can get rid of almost any pimple quickly by pairing this with her 4% BHA foam. I love the consistency of this product: it‚Äôs a slightly thick cream that doesn‚Äôt drip down once you‚Äôve put it on the blemish you‚Äôre trying to control. I like the consistency of this one significantly more than her normal strength spot treatment because it isn‚Äôt nearly as messy and works significantly better. The bottle is large and would last incredibly long, so if you‚Äôre just testing it out the trial size would last you probably nearly a month. Also, you probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to get away with applying this in the morning because even though they claim this sets to a matte finish, like many of her products, it never does. I don‚Äôt have terribly sensitive skin, and for the most part I can‚Äôt feel this after I‚Äôve applied it. That being said, if I have an open cut or dry skin, this definitely does sting, which is something to watch out for. Pros: This product does its job well, and it‚Äôs definitely the best spot treatment I‚Äôve ever used of hers, the clean and clear lines, and the proactiv line. You also get a large amount that will last you forever. Cons: This stings on dry/sensitive skin and is on the pricier side. It also won‚Äôt dry to matte, unnoticable finish - don‚Äôt trust Paula‚Äôs claims on that because I feel like none of her products ever do. Overall I‚Äôd definitely recommend this to anyone who struggles with acne breakouts because this is by far the best and fastest spot treatment I‚Äôve ever used (but it probably wouldn‚Äôt work nearly as well without a BHA exfoliant.) This was definitely worth the purchase, and if you‚Äôre looking into it you can use this link [...] to get $10 off, making this only $8.",RBRQ21PSGC8QC,5.0,A great spot treatment,5.0,485.7,AHV5KNZGTW5YPGFX57VMBVM2ZZLA,3,0,76875595,55,46,[False]

I feel it is worth while paying for this package.  The package is luxurioius/extraordinary. You will never disappointed when you open the package. It is really premium one. If you have never tried any Derma roller before, please just give a try. I found this item from my friend who has used this for few months. It was amazing because I could notice tons of positive changes on her face. But I admitted that I hesitated to buy this after adding into my cart because I had really sensitive skin and felt scared of getting side-effects. Now, I think I should have bought it earlier‚Ä¶ This seller‚Äôs derma roller has strong points like below. 1. Durable: The fine needles(0.3mm) are made of Titanium. Even though the needle sizes are smaller, its strength is really good. Also, durable and strong. By accident, I dropped one roller head into floor while changing a head into a different size. But needles are intact and there is no problem to keep using it.  Furthermore, Titanium is good for penetrating harder skin. Definitely, you can control the pressure depends on your skin condition. 2. Variety: In the package, there are 3 kinds of roller heads for under eye/nose, face/neck and body/legs.  Especially, I love using the smallest one for under eye areas and noses. 3. Booster: It contains collagen face cream and Vitamin C boosting serum. They also boost my collagen after Derma roller induces it. If I can buy the cream and Vit C serum separately, I would do. I can say that my skin is brighter and smoother after only 2 weeks. I use this roller every 48 hours with mild-moderate pressure (according to buyer‚Äôs brochure, recommended use is 1-2 times a week). It just takes me less than 10 mins to care my skin.

And my skin stayed soft and supple a lot longer. When my homemade butter ran out (and before I found time to make more), I simply starting using the pure avocado oil to moisturize my face, neck, arms, & legs. I was extremely pleased with the results! Then I tried another brand that was cheaper and offered a handy pump--disaster! Awful ""fishy"" smell and the skin softening results were nonexistent compared with this NOW brand. And the pump proved messier than the rocker cap opening. I tried to leave a review for the other brand, but the avocado oil is not currently listed among the ""flavors"" available. I recently bought another 16oz bottle of NOW avocado oil, and I'm happy to report that I am getting the same wonderful results as I had from the first 16oz bottle. Without the fishy smell--or any scent at all in fact. While I noticed that some of the above images for this product by NOW do not specify organic, I will point out that both of bottles I purchased from NOW bear the official USDA organic certified NON-GMO seal, (while the other brand marketed itself as ""Premium Organic"" without certification). Now, what to do with the leftover oil from the other brand? I hate to send it to the landfill.

[False],64,B083VY5GVN,"This stuff rocks. I see this product all over the internet as ‚Äúdermatologist recommended‚Äù plus EWG rates it highly. Mineral sunscreen holy grail for face and body. It‚Äôs very thick and gloopy out of the bottle, but when you start rubbing it in its turns a ghastly kabuki clown white. Be prepared to be shocked...but wait! It slowly dries clear, like on a scale of 1 to 10 no more than a 1.5 or 2. It‚Äôs amazing. When the product squirts out, it appears thick but when you start to rub it liquifies, and then it turns clear. You do have to rub in fairly aggressively, but even with my sensitive and thinning skin, does not irritate. No fragrance, and washes off easily with soap and water. High zinc oxide and titanium dioxide mineral content assures me of the sun protection I am guaranteed, plus the advocacy of many doctors and the EWG (environmental working group) which I trust to keep me safe. I am applying a full 1/2 teaspooon for face and neck, which further assures me of protection. It seems like a lot but when it dries down clear, you‚Äôll be glad to have enough on to make sure no more hyperpigmentation or dark spots appear. I am pacific island of descent so I‚Äôd have to be out there all day to burn; sunscreen is helping me to avoid further damage from my youth of suntan beds and sunbathing. I am treating my sun damage with retinol and lactic acid, so sunscreen is super important. I will repurchase this, which says a lot.

Edit 6/16/2020 EWG claims this sunscreens UVA rating will not pass the upcoming FDA proposed rating system. Although it claims a ‚ÄòGOOD‚Äô rating (not EXCELLENT) for UVA/UVB protection, its not enough for me because I am more interested in UVA protection. I have rejected this sunscreen and lowered it to 1 star.

Just wash your face and leave your nose area wet, then apply the strip with dry hands and then pat the top of the strip with a little more water to help it stick to your nose better, then leave it on for 15 minutes and afterwards, peel it off the strip when it is completely dried and there will be some blackheads or dried skin that come off with the strip. These strips helped cleaned my pores and it feels really refreshing. These have a minty feeling when applied which is very unique. I would recommend these and I think these would make great gifts.

I think, if people aren't seeing results from using the gel alone, they should at least incorporate core activation since it's super easy and you can do it while doing pretty much anything else.

[False],2,B07ZYQPFN1,"If you are using a roller micro-needle tool, DUMP IT! Yes, the roller tools are way cheaper, but this is worth it! I wish I could go back and buy this a long time ago. It is, truly, a game changer! I am a longtime roller user. I keep four different ones, with different depths, for use on different areas. And, yes they are cheaper, but they require a lot of vigilance to make sure they are replaced at regular intervals. And, even when I use the shortest needle, it still hurts and I'm often left with the ""drag"" marks that seem to be an unavoidable occasional side-effect. Despite this, I stick with it, because the benefits are worth it. I had thought about trying a derma pen for a while, but I kept putting it off because of the expense. It is worth the expense though! The discomfort of using the stamper is NOTHING compared to the roller. (I'm not saying it all felt pleasant, but it wasn't all painful either.) I could see the prick ""holes"" from the needles very clearly on my skin, so I knew it was doing the job (extremely gratifying); but, there wasn't a single tear from my eyes or ""drag"" marks left on my skin. One of the things I never considered, was how much more pleasant the needling process could be, if I wasn't having to control the speed and pressure manually. This derma pen lets you keep the same cartridge in, regardless of the depth you choose, and you can gradually increase the speed. The needling from the pen was much more thorough than what is possible with a roller and it was evident from the abundance of visible pricks and the redness left when I was done. Honestly, my face looked A LOT scarier than it ever has after the roller; but, this was because it was doing exactly what it is intended for. By the next morning, while still a little agitated, my skin was ok to go out in public. If you do a thorough treatment, your skin needs about four weeks to do the whole recovery/ rebuilding cycle that you're aiming for when you microneedle. I just did the treatment a couple of days ago; BUT, for the first time EVER, I am excited about the next treatment. If I could do it again tomorrow, I would. I have a lot of skincare gadgets, but this is (hands down) my new favorite. If you are using a roller, switch now! If you are new to derma-needling, start with this. This is truly a great product.

[False],6,B00B7V273E,"I never review products or companies. I research what I buy and if it works, I figure I got what I paid for. When things don‚Äôt work I send them back. I am compelled to review the entire Mad Hippie line of products AND the company( particularly Dana who I dealt with via email). I am not a beauty queen nor am I overly affected by my appearance. My favorite hobbies throughout life include: gardening, horses, biking, hiking, snorkeling, sunbathing and skiing. Outside stuff. I have had sun poisoning three times.I have wrinkles, age spots, dry and flaky spots, and red marks I was told were due to rosacea. I have a large pored, ruddy complexion and am prone to breakouts, blackheads and STILL have dry flaky spots. NOT FAIR! I figured you traded breakouts for dry skin later in life!  I am a  Mad Hippie, so I loved their name to begin with, it suited me. I have a facial hair problem and spend time plucking EVERYDAY. I have problems with ingrown hairs on my face and neck. I know what you‚Äôre thinking, ‚Äú winner, winner chicken dinner‚Äù. Well the surprise is, there are SOME people who believe I‚Äôm attractive( including, on occasion, myself). I still have a certain amount of pride as a woman and don‚Äôt leave this house until making sure I look good in my magnifying mirror. On my fifty eighth birthday, I decide to try a ‚Äúproduct line ‚Äú again. I have used Lanc√¥me, Est√©e Lauder, and last year Elizabeth Arden. I saw some results, but honestly not enough to justify exorbitant prices. I was very worried about skin cancer because of all of the chemicals. Some improved skin texture, some improved dark spots...but none of them fixed EVERYTHING. I saw the Mad Hippie line advertised somewhere on the internet. I researched it and was thinking, ‚Äúhmmmm, SOUNDS really good....‚ÄùSo I decided to buy all of their stuff and give it a try. Even though their products are priced well below department store brands, when I ordered them I price shopped on the Mad Hippie site and Amazon. In addition to all of the aforementioned complexion problems, I am also a price shopper. Ha! You can stop reading now, if you want, but you‚Äôre going to miss the best part! I wound up buying six of my products in a ‚Äú package‚Äù put together by the Mad Hippie folks. It was the best deal. The remaining 3 items I bought were from three different distributors on Amazon. ( I might have saved a few dollars, but hey,‚Äù a penny saved, a penny earned‚Äù, right? My Mad Hippie order came first...I used the cream cleanser and thought,‚ÄùThis is so creamy and easy to rinse, I just KNOW I‚Äôm going to break out.‚Äù Then I used the Vitamin C serum, waited ten minutes, used moisturizer and then eye cream. At night I switched the vitamin c for the exfoliating serum. The six pack didn‚Äôt come with the Vit A serum. The next day I saw a difference. My skin was different...more moist, smaller pores, less redness. No blackheads or breakouts people! Within a WEEK my dark spots faded more than they had after a whole bottle of Prevage serum. I think that one bottle of serum costs the same as ALL of my Mad Hippie products. Who knows what was in it??? Finally my SPF came in from Del Sol inc.( best price on Amazon). I wanted to protect my results from the sun! The bottle had leaked in shipping. This stuff was so thick, I could barely put it on! My face turned a weird color between pink and lilac. Every pore and line was filled with it. Yuck! I wrote an email to Mad Hippie. I explained how I loved everything else, but their sun screen was a nightmare. I heard back almost immediately. Dana explained that it must have been stored improperly because it sounded as if it had separated. I told her I got it through a different supplier. She felt extremes in temperature were the culprit . She asked for my address and said she was sending a new bottle. I was shocked that they were replacing something I bought through someone else! Well, not only did they do THAT but Dana also sent me the mist. She wrote an email and said she wanted to make sure I tried her favorite Mad Hippie product. The sunscreen came with a little yellow tag sealing the dispenser ( unlike the one from Del Sol). It is creamy and blends perfectly into my skin. IT DOES NOT SETTLE INTO WRINKLES AND PORES. IT DOESN‚ÄôT SMELL! I don‚Äôt feel greasy or mask like. I have always hated sunscreens. I never found one like this. My problems are definitely caused by the sun and now that I have found this , I will wear sunscreen religiously. Good move, right? Better late than never.. So here I am 3 weeks after my first experience with Mad Hippie. The cleanser is wonderful- don‚Äôt let its creaminess and rinsability fool you. It works. You use the mist right after washing (smells like a bouquet of fresh flowers, THANKS DANA :)and preps your skin for the serum. Vit C serum makes me glow(at 58, that‚Äôs something), that‚Äôs for daytime. Vit A or exfoliating serum for night. I started with just the Exfoliating serum at night and LOVE it, but am interspersing Vit A serum sometimes. It‚Äôs amazing. Follow serum with moisturizer and eye cream. I forgot the Antioxident oil! It got rid of the flakes on my nose( NOTHING EVER DID THAT BEFORE!) I thought I might be in some real trouble there...a flaky patch for YEARS! Overall.. after 3 weeks...My pores are smaller, no blackheads, faded dark spots (age spots), decreased redness, wrinkles less noticeable, dry spots gone AND the facial hair problem is somehow BETTER. Yes, it definitely is. Maybe because of exfoliation...but it‚Äôs much easier to deal with. I now wear a great sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt have any unpleasant side effects. This company is not only fair, but kind, helpful and giving. They give you support, advice, kindness, truly GREAT customer service AND THE BEST FACE PRODUCTS I have ever used.

[True],8,B0047AKVW6,"I like that this came in a large bottle so I'm not having to order it every few months. Hyaluronic acid is a staple in my facial skin care routine as I used it twice a day after washing. It is light and absorbs quickly. This does work well for day time use since it's a thinner consistency. I would have preferred a 2% after using this 1% versus a previous 2%. With 2% you can add a tiny bit of water for day time use under make-up but still have the thicker consistency at night. This is the reason this only gets 3 stars. I have to purchase a different brand of hyaluronic acid to use at night. Which brings me to the fact that this 8 is bottle will most likely expire before I can use it all. So in conclusion, purchasing a smaller quantity of the 2% will last about the same as 2x this product (for me personally). You will see my comparison of this and the 2% as this one is the more runny/thinner liquid.

[False],6,B07V4GGPJ2,"I purchased this through an online special directly from Beverly Hills MD, so my comments are just about the product and not the seller. I have only been taking it for a couple of weeks but in the first week I swore it was helping my scalp psoriasis to heal and now into the third week I can say that‚Äôs definitely the case. I also feel that my skin is becoming more moisturized from the inside, although I‚Äôve had periods of sloughing which made it feel rough, but I don‚Äôt care because exfoliation just helps to bring out fresh skin underneath. I think I see a slight difference in the depth of my forehead wrinkles, but that will probably take more time to really gauge the effectiveness for that. Definitely is helping areas of my scalp where I need patches of my hair to grow back. So I recommend the product. After some quick research online before I received the supplement I noted that there are dietary impacts that can help or hinder some of the processes the ingredients in this product support. The big one I came across was caffeine, which works against the hormonal balance & recalibration we‚Äôre trying to achieve with this complex. For me that‚Äôs a big deal, I won‚Äôt cut caffeine out entirely but I have watched my intake more closely. Anyway overall I say try it, if you can start out with one bottle/jar at this price and reassess (I bought 3 jars together), you won‚Äôt be out more than $40. I have decided I like it in the first month. However the studies I pulled up do say it takes about 3 months to see significant changes to wrinkle depth, FWIW.

[True],30,B07B1RX32P,"I'd like to start the review with this: the lotion works incredibly. I love Drunk Elephant products and I was stoked that this Protini moisturizer worked so well. My face is as clear as can be, and I didn‚Äôt even care that it was pricey. However, no reviews so far covered one discovery that I found a few days ago when I ran out of product about a month after purchasing (it‚Äôs $70 btw). This discovery can be seen in the attached photos that I took after I realized I purchased a total gimmick. The 1st photo I attached shows the tub taken apart into its 4 pieces. Starting from the left: the outer tub casing, the inner tub casing (also the 2nd photo), the pump mechanism, and the top lid. The gimmick is this: do you see the amount of space between the middle 2 pieces? Looks like about a 1/2 oz of lotion can fit there right? Now look at the amount of lotion space in the third photo, where it appears that the mechanism itself can hold about an oz. This would add up to about 1 1/2 oz, which makes 0 sense since the product is so large. But alas, look at the oz amount on the outer casing. It literally says 1.69 oz. Are you actually kidding me? When I realized this, I truly couldn't believe it. I encountered denial, because I love Drunk Elephant so much and I couldn‚Äôt understand why they were tricking their customers into thinking they were buying so much more. And on top of that, no one else seemed to have written a review yet noticing this, which I believe because it‚Äôs such a new brand. After looking more at the inner casing (2nd photo), I realized I had found the culprit: there are holes on the bottom of this casing. No lotion had ever entered this casing - this was filled with air to create the illusion that it held lotion. Although I loved the product, I will not buy this lotion again. I am really disappointed that this brand aimed to trick their clients as opposed to really showing them what they are paying for.",R2YOGKVWP8OMRM,1.0,There is less than 2 oz in the whole tub?!,3.5,105.5,AHLJQHEXXYIRS4WTXVLBVUZXNXTQ,12,7,2311891,41,0,[False]

[False],2,B07B1RX32P,"No scent! Not too heavy! So far, so good! IMPORTANT NOTE: Be careful not to mix certain other skincare products or ingredients with it (no matter what the website may say!). To be helpful, I have made a list of things NOT to mix at the same time and important tips. However, to be sure, ask a professional dermatologist: ‚Ä¢DO NOT MIX: -RETINOL should not be mixed with: Vitamin C, Vitamin E, AHA/BHA or Benzol Peroxide. -AHA/BHA should not be mixed with: Retinol, Vitamin C or Niacinamide (and possibly peptides but I am not 100% sure on that). -VITAMIN C should not be mixed with Retinol, AHA/BHA or Niacinamide. -VITAMIN E should not be mixed with Retinol. -NIACINAMIDE should not be mixed with AHA/BHA or Vitamin C -BENZOYL PEROXIDE should not be mixed with Retinol. NOTE: Both Retinol and AHA/BHA can be very helpful for various skin issues. While you should not MIX them, you can switch between them (example: Monday for Retinol, Tuesday for AHA/BHA, etc) nightly once your skin has been safely worked up to tolerating these more intense skin remedies. Do not try to do this all at once, right off the bat. ‚Ä¢SUN AND CARE: -While the Drunk Elephant website doesn‚Äôt always address this, in most cases RETINOL and AHA/BHA should be used at night as they cause sensitivity to the sun that can damage skin. I don‚Äôt know if applying sunscreen will fully keep your skin safe (not to mention all the reapplying). While you *may* be able to use it if you‚Äôre staying indoors, do understand that harmful rays can enter the home, car and workplace through windows. If you‚Äôre going to experience sun, regardless of what you do or do not put on your skin, an SPF of at least 30 should be an everyday routine (with reapplying). As for if you stay indoors, away from windows, one would assume hanging out in a dark room all day would suffice, but I‚Äôm no expert. -So it‚Äôs beat to use Retinol and AHA/BHA at night and wash it off in the morning. A cream or serum containing Vitamin C thrives off sunlight, so that is best to use in the daytime. ‚Ä¢IF YOU OVERDO THE SKIN TREATMENTS AND YOUR SKIN IS FEELING DRY OR IRRITATED: Take a break from the harsh products and use very gentle ones for a little bit. Particularly CERAMIDES. These are gentle and help your skin to heal, calm and moisturize your skin. I personally have used (and liked) ‚ÄúGood Cera Super Ceramide Emulsion (pH 5.5 / 7 free)‚Äù which is a nice, gentle moisturizer.

But first, I'll start out by telling you my ""history"". I have naturally very light skin and it's hard to find a color that is the perfect match. Plus most foundations feel very heavy on my skin and since I don't need too much coverage on a daily basis, I opted for this tinted moisturizer. PROS: -It's very lightweight on my skin; it feels natural and moisturizing, unlike a lot of foundations I've tried. -It evens out my skin tone; not dramatically, but there's definitely a difference. -The color that does show up blends perfectly into my skin. CONS: -Yes, I realize this is a tinted moisturizer, but I wish it had a little more coverage. Besides evening out my skin tone slightly, it doesn't do much in terms of covering up blemishes or redness (unless it's minor). Overall, I'm happy with this product for everyday use, although I'm sure I'll be trying out more tinted moisturizers and BB creams in the future.

[False],34,B0013OJWE2,"This truly is a great product. I've used many self tanners before and this is by far the best one. The mist really is a ""micro mist"" that goes on super fine for an all over even look. I'm mostly French and English so my skin tone is very fair. Seeing as my skin is so light I usually go for the light/medium self tanners. At first I purchased the micromist in the ""2 shades darker"" and it came out very natural looking. Almost too light for me though. I wanted a deeper color so I purchased the ""3 shades darker"" and the color came out beautiful. Not orange at all, just a natural tan glow. When applying be sure to not stay in one single spot on your body or you will get blotches. You must spray in continuous, even strokes. Also, be careful on hands and feet, you really only need a quick even spray or else the color will look too dark. When spraying hands; make sure to keep fingers spread apart and slightly bent. Another quick tip is I apply a little lotion on the creases of my fingers, toes, back of heels, elbows and knees. A huuuge tip is to definitely exfoliate. The best results will come from clean, fresh exfoliated skin. After the tan has set in completely, usually after 8 hours, I take a quick shower. I don't use soap, just let warm water rinse off any excess. Then after I apply lotion. Lotion is key in maintaining the original color.

[False],3,B01FGV958A,"So I'll start off by saying that I have eczema. Bad eczema. It's pretty terrible year round, but it ramps up to 11+ during the summer. Heat + humidity + friction from my clothes = a bright red disaster by August. I use tons of creams and soaps to manage it, including other soaps from Southern Natural, but after showering or applying creams, I run into the problem of having too much moisture on my skin (which causes itching) or too little moisture (which makes my skin feel super tight, promotes even more itching, and then causes it to blister and break). When the chance to try Southern Natural's new Dead Sea Mud Bamboo Charcoal Soap came up, I jumped at the opportunity. I actually started buying from SN about two years ago at Birmingham's Pepper Place Market. My go-to soap had been the Castille and Unscented goat milk soaps, but they never quite reached the HG (Holy Grail) soap status. And at this point, with the temperature outside being 87 degrees and feeling like 110 with the humidity (leaving me a red, angry, itching mess), I was desperate to try anything. Day 1: Could smell the soap through the box. Minty, like gum. My husband was sure I had purchased some kind of ridiculous Prime deal that consisted of all the mint gums in the world. Nope. Just the soap. At this point, I'm hoping it's not so fragranced that I can't use it, because of the holy trifecta of allergies, eczema, and asthma, I somehow scored two of the three. Two bars of soap arrived, and the package came with the seriously life changing soap sock. I would have purchased for the soap sock alone, to be honest. Never have my bars of soap lasted so long. Like when you wash with most charcoal soaps, you're going to have one of two thoughts: 1) ""Holy cow, I'm dirty!"" or 2) ""What the heck? Why is the bottom of my tub gray?"" No difference from other charcoal soaps here. Gray suds, gray soap--to be expected. The soap lathered nicely, even with my terrible hard water. The smell wasn't as overpowering as I thought; a byproduct of heat exposure while shipping, I suppose. Only the faintest hint of mint remained once the soap hit the water, like a gentle whiff of peppermint oil. Once out of the shower, though, I noticed that my skin didn't feel as moisturized as I had hoped. It seemed dry, tight, like I had washed by body with dishwashing soap. A little discouraged, but reminding myself that skin takes a few days to get used to new products, I slathered on some cream and agreed to try again with tomorrow's shower. Day 2: Showered again (obviously, as who would admit to not showering on Amazon, of all places?) Gray soap, gray water, same light mint smell, same rich lather. Wash up, step out, pat dry. Notice a difference. Yesterday my skin felt like a stretched piece of dry, cracking leather. Today, it feels... softer. Smoother. Dare I say, moisturized? By this point, I've already decided that I'm doing a full week test on this soap. You know, for science. Day 3: Same shower, different day. Post physical therapy, so we're going to see how this bad boy helps with irritated, dirty skin. As I'm showering, I'm surprised by the feel of my skin. The irritation that left me scratching has calmed down. I'm no longer a tomato. My skin has started to peel, but I think that's a good thing with all the exfoliation from the soap sock. Days 4-7: Shower, shower, shower, shower. This is the longest I've ever gone without creams or moisturizers. My skin is no longer tight or peeling. In fact, my skin is actually softer. My husband has started stealing the soap. He hates wearing lotions, but the soap has left his skin moisturized without sticky creams as well. Writing this post-day 7 shower and my skin is like velvet. I'm still wondering if I can get this soap by the pound (or even by the ton) so I never run out. Overall impression: Fantastic soap. Seriously. With the addition of the soap sock, this is so close to being my HG soap. If it made my eczema go away and never return, it would be my HG for sure, but I know with my skin, only medicated creams make it go away for good. Love the scent--soothing peppermint, which definitely made the bathroom smell fantastic and helped to calm my redness. I'm nowhere close to finishing this bar, but once I do, I'm immediately slipping in the second bar!

A single pressing of the pump dispenses exactly the right amount for a thorough hand washing and I definitely appreciate the silky suds that appear when I'm rubbing my hands together.  A great second use for a very much appreciated product.  By the way, don't forget to take off the white plastic clip on the pump dispenser that keeps the soap from coming out.

[False],64,B083VY5GVN,"This stuff rocks. I see this product all over the internet as ‚Äúdermatologist recommended‚Äù plus EWG rates it highly. Mineral sunscreen holy grail for face and body. It‚Äôs very thick and gloopy out of the bottle, but when you start rubbing it in its turns a ghastly kabuki clown white. Be prepared to be shocked...but wait! It slowly dries clear, like on a scale of 1 to 10 no more than a 1.5 or 2. It‚Äôs amazing. When the product squirts out, it appears thick but when you start to rub it liquifies, and then it turns clear. You do have to rub in fairly aggressively, but even with my sensitive and thinning skin, does not irritate. No fragrance, and washes off easily with soap and water. High zinc oxide and titanium dioxide mineral content assures me of the sun protection I am guaranteed, plus the advocacy of many doctors and the EWG (environmental working group) which I trust to keep me safe. I am applying a full 1/2 teaspooon for face and neck, which further assures me of protection. It seems like a lot but when it dries down clear, you‚Äôll be glad to have enough on to make sure no more hyperpigmentation or dark spots appear. I am pacific island of descent so I‚Äôd have to be out there all day to burn; sunscreen is helping me to avoid further damage from my youth of suntan beds and sunbathing. I am treating my sun damage with retinol and lactic acid, so sunscreen is super important. I will repurchase this, which says a lot. I have only repurchased a few of the dozens of sunscreens Ive tried. I prefer mineral over chemical. I like affordable products. It‚Äôs hard to find the ‚Äúone‚Äù but this one is coming close. Edit 6/16/2020 EWG claims this sunscreens UVA rating will not pass the upcoming FDA proposed rating system. Although it claims a ‚ÄòGOOD‚Äô rating (not EXCELLENT) for UVA/UVB protection, its not enough for me because I am more interested in UVA protection. I have rejected this sunscreen and lowered it to 1 star.

Also, it's not easy to rub in - and - as with all zinc products - i must moisturize before or else it's too hard to rub in, and my skin gets dry and feels sensitive - it's better than the lotion - but not worth the grainy feel -",R2FJXNQKG12F3K,2.0,Might Scratch Your Skin_ Grainy_Not Easy to Rub in,3.3,162.1,AH2NJNNBNKRS3ZU7Q2ZSFENQRZNA,27,9,2720141,57,0,[False]

It's hard to use. since it reeks so bad, I just use in on my feet and use socks to help with the restless leg syndrome.

While the weather is still cool / cold and I'm still wearing sweats, this is OK, but one it warms up, there will be no way to use this cream while wearing shorts. This cream doesn't absorb in, and will make a oily mess on furniture. Also, it's so 'there' even after being on my legs under sweats by the time I got to bed, that I stick to the sheets. I'm not fond of that feeling. On the nights I use this, I end up tossing and turning quit a bit because of being so sticky. Because of this, I'll be looking for a different magnesium remedy to try.

I am giving it three stars, but I want to provide some details because some of the things that I didn‚Äôt like you may REALLY like, and vice versa. LIKES 1.  Nice light creamy texture - easy to apply 2.  REALLY moisturizes (but see one of my dislikes) 3.  The scent is pleasant - similar to baby oil (but again, see one of my dislikes) 4.

I don‚Äôt have really dry skin, so that may be why. 2.  While the scent is pleasant, it is pretty strong!  Almost overpowering... and it linger.  This is very surprising to me coming from Cetaphil as their products usually don‚Äôt have fragrances (or at least not nearly this strong).  At least it is a pleasant scent though. 3.  Because of the strong fragrance I have a bit of concern using it too closely to my eyes (which is really where I wanted it for). For me I will probably put this on the back burner and come back to it during the winter when my skin tends to be much dryer than it is in the constant 90%+ humidity here in NC!

I wanted to use something that wouldn't cause me to break out which is why I decided to give this face cream a try. Not only is it advertised as light-weight but also has a gentle scent. Lets take a look at how accurate that is through normal use. Scent/Light-Weight: The scent I have to admit smells pretty good but I believe the smell is a little bit too overpowering for the face. While the scent isn't bad but you will most likely be smelling it for a little bit when you put it on. Furthermore, while the product is a supposed to be light-weight but I found it too be a little bit too thick to be a face cream. I would have preferred it to be a little later so a thin layer only needs to be applied. It does do a pretty good job in being non greasy and not getting all over the place for me though. Moisturizing: The moisturizing part is the most important to me and this does a great job. I apply this product right before bed every day and feel rejuvenated when I wake up in the morning. That to me is the job that I want with the face cream. I usually apply right before bed because of the dry air here in California.

[False],5,B07SWJ3QJQ,"Petroleum jelly is a main ingredient in many beauty products, even in the very expensive brands. So, obviously, it can be used in plenty of ways for personal care and grooming, such as: --helps protect and heal scrapes and burns --moisturizes skin on hands, feet, legs, face. --removes eye makeup. --tames split ends on hair. --soothes diaper rash. But how about some other uses?  There are loads of other uses, like: --protecting your pet's paws. --preventing stains on skin (from hair dye for example). --unsticking things like zippers, hinges, drawers, doors. --adding shine and protection to shoes and leather items. And I've just scratched the surface of what you can do with Petroleum Jelly! The nice part about this Solimo brand is: 1) it's a bit cheaper than the major brand we all know. 2) it has a very, very mild lavender scent, which makes it pleasant to use as a beauty product. 3) you get just about a lifetime supply when you order this 12 pack! The ONLY reason I'm rating this 4 stars instead of 5, is BECAUSE you get 12 jars with this order. Which, at 13 oz. per jar, is a LOT of product, and some folks might not need or want that much.

Secondly, it took longer than 15 minutes for the mask to completely dry... took more like 30 minutes, and I didn‚Äôt even apply it very thick! Thirdly, it has almost a perfume smell.

So I‚Äôm confused because why would a face mask even have sulfates?! Sulfates makes shampoos, body washes, toothpaste and etc lather up!! Anyway.. charcoal sucks impurities from the skin.. my skin didn‚Äôt feel any different after rinsing off the mask.

I am 32 and have been feeling very self conscious about my newly appearing wrinkles that have been unable to be hidden with makeup recently. I was desperately searching for a solution that I could actually understand the science behind, because I am not a person who can pay $300 a treatment to go get botox every three months - nor do I believe in doing treatments that don‚Äôt actually work permanently. I just don‚Äôt have time for those. I do have a friend who got microneedling done years ago and I had asked her what she did because she looks younger than me at almost 50 years old. So I can preface by saying that this works years later. After doing my own research, I looked at science based medical journals on the results and the process that the body goes through when microneedling is used and I can whole heartedly say that the science behind this treatment makes sense to reduce fine lines like I was looking to do. I attached pictures, the before pictures are me in every day life (I didn‚Äôt take proper pictures) - feeling self conscious about how aged I looked. Specifically forehead and around the eye wrinkles. I even have makeup on in the pictures at the restaurant and it did nothing to hide those lines. After pictures taken After only my second treatment with this product and I am totally in awe and feeling so much more confident. I used a 5% topical lidocaine and left it on the skin for 30 minutes before treatment, then a natural vitamin C serum for treatment. I also watched YouTube videos for hours on proper technique and depth of needling under eyes and forehead. This pen works and I can‚Äôt wait for after my fourth treatment! The nurses at work are already noticing and asking me what I‚Äôm doing for my skin! Woohoo! Update: I just finished my fourth treatment (see pictures) and I feel like I look like I‚Äôve erased years of lines. I can‚Äôt believe how well it‚Äôs working.

While the results from this essence were not as dramatic as the results from the serum, I definitely noticed a boost in my skin textures overall evenness and in the feeling of clear radiance from my skin. I looked like I had slept a lot better than I did! I recently had a chance to try the SK-II essence that everybody has been raving about for so many years, since I found it in a tester pack from Sephora. It actually did nothing for me, and potentially even caused some skin irritation that week. I was really not impressed either with how it felt or with the fact that I got zero results. Also, that product is owned by Procter & Gamble, which makes me not 100% trust that they care about the quality of ingredients going into it. This one, by contrast, felt soothing and smoothing going on, did not irritate my sensitive skin, and seemed to set the stage for my other products to work better. It has a watery texture and I did not use a cotton ball to apply it, just sprinkled a tiny bit in my hand and applied, let it dry, used my moisturizing toner, let that dry, then used the serum and let that soak in before my final moisturizing steps.

I then use an essence spray I got from Korea, followed by a serum and then moisturizer. Yes, this involves a lot of steps, but your skin will really thank you. I REALLY like this serum. First of all, a little goes a LONG way. A small pump or two is enough to cover your face. It goes on really smoothly, and it feels very light while also moisturizing your skin. It does not leave a heavy film on your face like some other products do. It does not have a scent, which I like. It helps my skin to feel much firmer and plump.

It appears to be a little thick or heavy, but it isn‚Äôt.  I use a small (pea sized) amount. It goes on well, feels great on the skin and provides a thin protective layer over your face or neck.

It is not overwhelming or strong. As far as immediate results go, I did notice that after washing my face with a gentle cleanser and applying this moisturizer, the skin on my face felt softer and had a faint glow. I did not notice any irritation or redness, nor did I have any reactions to any of the ingredients. But of course, only long-term use and time will tell the long-term effects on my skin.

[False],11,B00014FSXO,"This is a longtime favorite nighttime moisturizer of mine. I have dry, acne prone skin that's difficult to keep moisturized. I also use a retinoid to keep my skin clear, which makes my skin even drier. This is a thick, almost greasy (but in a good, moisturizing way) cream that's perfect for layering on overnight to wake up to soft, supple skin. It absorbs quickly and while it does leave a slight amount of residue on top of your skin, it's not noticeable unless you apply makeup overtop. I have tried a thin layer under my makeup on my dryer and it doesn't have any ill effect on my makeup, but if you don't wipe off the excess first it feels like wearing a mask. It's also heavily scented like melon flavored candy, but I like the smell of it. It's not an overpowering smell, but it's very obvious there's perfume in it when you open the jar. It fades after application. If your skin gets irritated by perfumes in your products this may not be for you, but this moisturizer doesn't irritate my acne prone skin. It doesn't burn when applied, no matter how dry or chapped my skin is. This stuff can migrate a little bit, so you really have to try and not rub your eyes because if the moisture gets in your eyes, it can sting. A lot. Wash your face, rinse your eyes, and start your skincare routine over kind of sting. I love the vitamin E in this, and I think it helps heal the red marks I get from acne much quicker than other moisturizers. When I'm having bad skin days I apply a thicker layer over my acne prone areas and dry patches, and when I wake up my skin looks less inflamed and my dry patches aren't flaky anymore.

It's a large bottle and sells for a very reasonable price. The smell is extremely pleasant. A very clean and refreshing scent that reminds me of the products they use at the spa. I tend to lean towards more exfoliant face washes rather than cream face washes simply because I feel like they leave my skin feeling cleaner. I've used some exfoliating face washes that had too tiny of grains leaving my face feeling not very clean. And I've used exfoliating face washes where the grains in the product were too large and coarse, feeling more like sandpaper than a face wash, and leaving my skin feeling raw. The grains in this are JUST RIGHT. Not too few or too many. And not too small or too big. The only thing I cannot vouch for is how well it helps treat acne. I have very bad skin and have suffered with acne my whole life. But after taking a new medication from my dermatologist my skin has cleared up.

When I decided to check them out, I went on their website and saw only 5 star reviews and a handful of 4 star reviews. Obviously, I had very high expectations of this product.  I bought the introductory kit which sampled 4 of their best-selling products.  I tried it for 1 month.  I didn't notice any improvement in my skin and even experience a few pimples when I haven't broken out in years.  Which was fine I wasn't upset, everyone's skin is different.  I received an email from the company asking me to review the product.  I gave it an average 3 star review and explained why.  A few weeks later, I went back to the website and looked for my review...it wasn't there.  I thought it was strange, so I posted directly on the product link a new 3 star review.  I received an email saying they would post my review after it had been reviewed for approval.  Now, a few weeks later, I checked the website again, and surprise surprise..my average review was never published.  This makes me very angry.

[False],5,B06XHH3GLF,"This is such an amazing inexpensive little tool! One of my favorite cleansers of all time is the Caudalie Foaming cleanser but sometimes it doesn't address issues that I'm dealing with and I'm always switching up my cleanser anyway based on my skin needs at the moment or how much makeup I've worn that day. This tool allows me to turn ANY cleanser into a lightweight foam! I love foam cleansers because they are so easy to use and rinse off (especially without having to use a wash cloth) and they leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed. They're gentler on the skin which makes them perfect for sensitive skin! This may seem like an unnecessary additional step, but it seriously only takes seconds to do and actually cuts the time of cleansing by half for myself personally. This is also fantastic for extending your cleanser! Some of my cleansers are extremely expensive and anything that allows me to extend the usage between repurchasing is a HUGE bonus and completely worth it in my book. All you do to get a soft dense foam is add a pearl sized amount of your cleanser into the cup, then add water to the water line which is marked outside of the cup. Stick the pump on top and gently start to pump up and down. It is plastic and lightweight and you don't need to use any force. It's very obvious when your cleanser is done foaming up as it will rise to the top. At the beginning you do have to kind of hold the lid in place as you start to pump but then you can let go because the suction keeps it in place. Scoop out the foam with your fingers after wetting your face (unless you prefer to dry cleanse) and go to work! You'll find that you don't even use all of the foam this little tool provides and you've used less cleanser than you typically would have! Then just rinse out the cup and pumps and let air dry. This tool is also a huge benefit for cleansers that don't lather which can be more difficult to work into the skin, yet it provides the same amount of cleansing capability. I really think that this is an invaluable little tool and if you're a skincare junkie like I am, you definitely need to have this little tool in your arsenal.

I‚Äôm 38 years old women with normal and medium tone skin, with some wrinkles, lack of elasticity and tired face. I never used a facial treatment before and sometimes my skin is sensitive. My routine since received the treatment was washed my face with the Scrub Cleanser in the morning with circle motions (avoid eyes) and then rinse. Then with just one pump (It covers all my face) I put the sunscreen Bright Day Moisturizer. In the night I washed my face again with the Scrub Cleanser and then I used Brightening Peel Pads in circle motions (avoid eyes) and then with one pump the Overnight Moisturizer. So far all the treatment has been working well, my face is not tired anymore, its feels young, I feel my wrinkles less noticeable and also even the tone of my skin. All the changes start since the first day of treatment, my skin feels so soft and young, hydrated. I know the product is a little expensive and I only used for 2 weeks, but I bet the Moisturizer is going to last at least 2 months, so you only have to buy the pads and scrub monthly. Brightening Day Moisturizer it contain all the moist and sun protection that your skin needs, it‚Äôs a SPF 30 is white in color with an acid smell (I love it) Its really easy to spread on your skin and with just 1 pump you can cover all your face, also you feel you skin hydrated and lighter and ready to apply makeup.  After you apply it immediately feels your skin brighter, silky and smooth and my wrinkles were reduced since I started to use it. If you use it 1 time per day I estimate is going to last 2 months. If you have the opportunity to buy the whole treatment I recommend it, it worth to spend all the money in you, you deserve it and you are going to feel younger, brighter, with a soft skin, even tone skin and the most important with less wrinkles.

[False],0,B06XHPB9SG,"I have been using this for going on 3-4 weeks.  The first week was 'meh', but by the 2nd week I noticed much younger skin all over my body.  I didn't even apply this everyday, just 3 or 4 times a week as a body-lotion over my whole body and that was enough to give fantastic results. I'm a 45 year old man and my neck skin was starting to give a kind of 'crepe' effect when I was slouching on the couch and I noticed it when I accidentally put my phone in selfie mode.  It looked like 'old man' skin.  Freaked me out.  I did all kinds of research and tried several face serums that we're 'okay' then bought this stuff which is gives a GENEROUS amount of creme.  Enough that I could use it as a body-lotion. Well, the stuff works.  After a few weeks of consistent moisturizing daily on my neck (3-4 times a week on my full body), the skin smoothed back out and didn't look all dry and 'old' anymore.  The skin on my chest, shoulders and back look highly improved.  Much more youthful. I'm now considering trying full-body red light therapy in a local THOR machine locally (expensive) as a treatment in addition to this fantastic lotion for 3 months then look at how much more youthful I can get my skin to look.  IMO, this is one of the cheapest, most effective and dramatic improvements you can get for your skin.  I tried several face 'serums' but they were in such small quantities that I couldn't put them all over my body, but with this product, I can, at a very affordable price and get results no body lotion gives that I've tried. Sorry, I'm not posting pictures of myself but will give my honest results.  It was good enough compared to other products that I thought I would share my results.  Also, this stuff is brightening my skin. ---->Attention, I think this stuff kind of stained a few of my shirts due to applying it when I was still wearing the clothing, so make sure you are fully dry after applying before putting on colorful clothing and don't wear anything while you're applying this stuff.

[True],2,B07BSVJ4H8,"I got this as a gift in July 2018 and I'm so pleased with it! Clean-it Zero (Purifying) solved every annoyance or issue I've had with removing make-up and is the easiest, fastest, most effective makeup remover I've ever used! I'm a skeptic with beauty or skin product but this one lives up to its claim. I have dry skin but am prone to breakouts in a few spots, so many other products either make my skin feel tight and dry or break me out. I usually use Simple Cleansing Wipes because they're low or non-irritating (and they're great) but I've started wearing liquid lipstick so I also needed a make-up remover with oil and I *hate* having to use multiple products. On top of the liquid lipstick problem, I've always had issue getting one part of my difficult eyeliners completely off no matter what product I used (there always seems to be a spot that refuses to come off between a couple eyelashes) and having to rub or use eye-make remover usually irritated that part of my eyelid and made it impossible to wear eyeliner multiple days in a row. This takes my stubborn eyeliner off easily and without irritating my eyes! Use: I can use about a dime-sized amount of Clean It Zero from the spatula on dry skin and get my foundation, mascara, stubborn eyeliner, AND liquid lipstick off in less than 45 seconds (I have to concentrate a little of it on the lipstick otherwise it takes 20 seconds to get my makeup off). This doesn't irritate my skin or that part of my eyelid that I had issues with, doesn't dry me out or cause acne, and it doesn't leave my skin feeling tight after it's washed off. I can use less than that amount on days I'm not wearing liquid lipstick and/or stubborn eyeliner and it's just as effective. I've also used it as a generic facial wash on days when I'm not wearing make-up just to help keep my face clear. Size: The container was a little smaller than I expected it to be; I thought it'd be larger than my palm so that it prevented my first knuckle from closing around the container but it turned out to be right about palm-sized. It's also a little shorter than a lip balm (first picture). I've used the product for about 2 or 2.5 weeks and you can see I haven't even had to scrap an entire top layer off thr product yet (second picture) and haven't even used half an inch of it in depth yet (third picture; left side shows part of the smooth unused section; middle to right side is used), so despite my original concern with the container being slightly smaller than expected I'm very happy with it and expect it to last for months. 2019 Update: It's a few months short of a year since I bought this and I'm just starting to get low. I've also found out that my sensitive-skinned family member (who can't even use most lip glosses) can use this without it irritating them.",R2ZPZREFTCV5PY,5.0,Lives up to all the Hype!

[False],2,B07BSVJ4H8,"I bought this product after realizing that the old version (purity) raised its price $10. I wanted to give it a try and I was a bit wary because some of the reviewers said they received fakes. I ended up receiving an authentic product from the seller Jolse (who I usually buy from for Korean stuff). It came with the scooper packaged nicely with instructions and the cap and it wasn‚Äôt melted or uneven. The reason I don‚Äôt like this product is because of the strong scent (or fragrance?) and the consistency. I‚Äôm not sure if the scent is a synthetic fragrance but it smelled like one and it turned me off this product right away. For the consistency, I definitely noticed a change compared to the previous version. This version feels much more balmy. I feel like I have to rub the product more into my skin in order for it to turn oily to get rid of my makeup. The previous version melted into an oil quicker so that I can use less product and achieve the same result. Some people might not like an oil consistency but it wasn‚Äôt like the oily makeup removers that dripped down your face and onto your clothes. It stayed on your face and washed off like a cleanser. This version caused me to use twice the amount of product which felt like a total waste. I honestly really hate this version.

Within about 20 mts, the bites had all but disappeared.  No itching, no blisters, no redness.  All that's left is a slight bump.  I can't explain it, but it worked.

The masks have the wire that sits across the nose that can be shaped to prevent some of the fogging up on my glasses.

Then I repeat this over and over again. You should be applying a bottle cap full of sunscreen to your face for protection.

I don't even usually apply powder after I use it because the coverage this gives me is enough. And because it absorbs into the skin, it doesn't ""slide off"" in hot weather. I had no problem finding the right shade for my skin tone (a problem I have with other makeups) and the SPF is a bonus, too.

[False],1,B01MDOA0V4,"Summary: Feels heavy and greasy but that's just how most zinc is, non irritating, but wore HORRIBLY under foundation. Application/feeling/finish: The first time I put this on I didn't know what to think-- it's a heavy, greasy feeling, yet it looks matte on the skin, and it leaves a visible white cast that does fade away somewhat if you give it time to sit (I'm quite pale, though, so I imagine this could be a complete deal breaker for someone with dark skin). Really that's just how a most zinc sunscreens are, though. The white cast isn't the end of the world for me because I wear makeup daily over my sunscreen, and in one sense I did like that it was kinda thick because I was using it without a moisturizer (oily skin). The heavy, greasy feeling was at first really the worst part... Eventually I realized it was doing weird things under foundation (more on that later). Sensitive skin: The biggest pro is that it is NOT irritating in the slightest. I've had a few bad experiences in the past with chemical sunscreens on my acne-prone, sometimes sensitive skin. They'll be fine one day, then the next day for some reason my skin revolts and gets red and burns around my mouth and nose after applying them. Chemical sunscreens also often irritate my eyes, but I like applying sunscreen right up to my eyes since that's some of the most delicate, easily damaged skin by the sun. This sunscreen was completely gentle, absolutely NO irritation to speak of. Wearing under makeup: Biggest con for me is that this did NOT react well to being worn under foundation. I started wearing this in the spring, when my skin isn't as terribly oily. My foundation usually breaks down by the end of the day around my nose, chin, and forehead, as there's only so much you can do to prevent that if your skin is really oily like mine. I didn't really notice a difference in that sense with this underneath in the spring--I assumed any separation was just unavoidable and nothing new. But as it got hotter and became summer, my foundation kept doing this weird thing where even just a few hours after applying it would form little dots around my nostrils mostly, but also on my chin and between my eyebrows. It was pretty bad looking. I tried using mattifying and smoothing primers, switching foundations, putting extra moisturizer or less moisturizer in those areas, powdering the areas more to prevent my oils from coming through (I was convinced oil was the culprit breaking down the product). Finally I stopped using this sunscreen and IT WENT AWAY. I still get some separation after hours and hours of wear, but nothing close to the gross separation into dots that this sunscreen caused. It wasn't even like my skin was super greasy to the touch, and no amount of blending with fingers or a sponge on top would get rid of the dots. I never wore this product without foundation over top since I wear foundation literally every day I leave the house and wear sunscreen, so I can't speak about if this would separate on its own. If you're looking for a good mineral zinc sunscreen for the face, I'd highly recommend the Derma-e Antioxidant Natural Sunscreen with SPF 30 and Clear Zinc for the Face (there's also a body formulation). It's non-irritating, but also has a much more light feeling that sinks in with hardly any residue, minimal white cast, and best of all doesn't change how my foundation wears. It's amazing, and I'm still in disbelief that it's actually a zinc sunscreen. It's a little pricier but completely worth it. Even if you don't wear foundation I still don't think this Neutrogena product is very good--it will feel heavy and leave a white cast. The derma-e sunscreen feels incredibly lightweight and the white cast is hardly noticeable (again, disclaimer: I have fair skin).",R24MODIPMDLUC3,2.0,"Heavy feeling, leaves white cast, doesn't wear well with makeup, but at least it's not irritating",2.0,675.0,AEU3R6IZLRZZMM7FOKAWILMKUX4A,1,0,37725314,0,0,[False]

Which, speaking of getting off, took washing twice with a loofah and scrubbing as hard as possible. To top it all off, I washed the white shorts I had on with this sunscreen and there were yellow stains where the fabric rubbed on the sunscreen. I'm working on getting the stains out, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I'd much rather use another top-rated chemical-free sunscreen I bought for my baby.

[False],94,B001QFDTWO,"There are, as you get older, some facts that simply must be confronted.  Some things in life get better; some things get worse.  For most people, and I most certainly include myself in this group, we find that as we age our skin becomes dryer and less supple. Now there are a few lucky ones out there, I grant you that, but I don't happen to be one of them.  There is also the fact that if you work in certain occupations or are exposed to every disease known to mankind, you must constantly wash your hands.  I have worked in the health care industry for the past 30 years and now work in a middle school.  Needless to say hand washing in a constant in my life.  Clean hands are nice and they are necessary but via the process of washing your hands and applying endless doses of hand cleanser, you end up with very dry skin. Also, in my case, I have to face the reality that I have been taking cholesterol lowering medication for quite a few years now which most certainly affects the skin and on top of that I am a diabetic.  I am not whining about either of these factors...it simply is what it is and I have had to learn to live with it. And this is where Gold Bond Ultimate comes in.  I hate dry hands and I hate dry skin.  It looks horrible and feels worse. I can tell you truthfully that I have tried at one time or another just about every product available.  Some of them were pretty good.  Some of them were kind of sort of okay, and some of them were next to useless for various reasons. (More about that later).  After all this trying of this and that I have found that the product being reviewed here is absolutely the best in my case.  It has several things going for it. When you apply it to your hands and skin you do not get that greasy feeling you do with so many products.  It seems to soak right into the skin.  I am a finger snapper and pointer (A very useful skill to have when working with middle school kids).  I can apply this lotion and can immediately still snap my fingers.  The kids don't like it so much but have learned that a finger snap is much less traumatic than being yelled at. (I have a rather booming voice and I hate yelling). I can nail a kid at twenty feel with a snap of my fingers, a point and a glare. Works great. Then we have the scent.  I absolutely hate heavily scented products of any sort.  The bottle states ""Fresh Clean Scent.""  This is absolutely true.  You really cannot smell the stuff all that much after it is applied and what little scent you do pick-up is rather pleasing. Gold Bond does indeed act as a healing agent.  I use it on my arms, legs, feet and knees paying particular attention to elbows and heels.  Folks, for me, this stuff truly works. You do not have to glob on massive amounts of this stuff.  A little goes a long, long way. Relatively speaking, this product is far less expensive than many other products that make the same ilk. Now for everything I know of there are also down sides.  That is sort of life when you think about it and there are a couple of things you need to be aware of when purchasing and using this product. First there is the container; specifically the pump.  This has been pointed out by several reviewers and they are spot on.  The pump simply stops working and you end up with about one forth of the product left in the container and you must be quite creative in getting the lotion out of the bottle.  I am not sure who or what created the pumps for this product but I am pretty sure there is probably a special ring in hell for them.  What a wonderful product; what a horrid delivery system.  A pox on their house. Second, this product is produced by Chattem Inc.  Chattem Inc. does use animals to test their products on.  Gold Bond is just one of quite a number of brands and products which are produced by this company. I try my best when ever possible to purchase products that do not use test animals.  In this case I have not been able to find a product that is as effective (by a long way) manufactured without using animals for testing.  It is sort of like the fact that I try my best to buy only products made in the U.S.  Unfortunately I live in the real world and if I stuck to this practice of buying only American I fear I would own very little.  It is what it is folks. Overall this is a great product and I will continue using it until something better comes along.

[False],1,B00Q23KDDS,"I have used Biore products for years but this is the first time I used an exfoliating product that uses natural charcoal. The process is quite simple as you wash your face with warm water and you pump the charcoal pore minimizer on your hands and lather your face.  Then you wash immediately. I have utilized this for a few days and I have not had problems with any burning sensation, nor did it smell bad. If anything, right after you are done, you will start to feel your face feel as if there is still product on your face.  In fact, it kind of reminds me of the old Biore mask that you had to peel off, but in this case, no peeling off, it's just the product working and the micro-crystals worked great.  I felt it working on my cheek area, forehead, near my nose and I am actually quite thrilled with the product. For guys, there are skin care products that you need...a cleanser to remove the dirt and oil and purify the skin (use in the morning), an exfoliant that helps further the cell renewal process and lifting off the top layer of dead skin cells (best to use at night), a toner for hydration and lotion with SPF if needed. So, definitely continue to use the cleanser for when you wake up, use the Biore Charcoal Pore Minimizer before you go to bed.

The unfortunate part was that the bar did not last very long. It was gone in a little over a week with two people using it regularly. I then went on to use the Raspberry Sorbet. The color bled allover the shower which can be a pain. The scent was okay. It seemed much fainter than the other bar. I didn't love it. The same goes for the other two bars.

My least favorite is Cool Spring Scrub and the scent is just too intense and the blue too deep for my personal preference. My favorite is Cool Fresh Aloe because the scent is strong enough to be there and I liked the green swirled into the light cream color. I'm not a huge fan of blue so the Cool Water variety didn't appeal to my eyes but the scent was much lighter than my least favorite soap.

[False],1,B00UREAGU8,"Going to compare this product with a similar one from another brand , I noticed they changed the ingredients so I got curious and looked for the product to see which one was the original or at least to compare, I have been buying this product for years and only now noticed there are about 2 different brands that sell this same product but labeled under a different name. I bought this one and another brand to compare the both of them and see which is better, right after I opened this I noticed they both looked, smelled and felt exactly the same! Which really made me question whether this is not just the exact same product labeled differently, so far a little sketchy. Then I tried removing it and noticed that the Majestic Pure was a lot easier to remove than the other brand I bought, which made me think in all honesty that this one is probably better but I've yet to make a complete review I need to make sure there are no strange reactions on my skin and both products work correctly, but like I mentioned before they literally look, smell and feel like the exact same product, I am not a fan of the new added smell of Lavender because even though I love lavender and that smell in particular, I really loved this product for it's particular smell it had and also the fact it had no added chemicals, or in this case, fragance, fragance usually contains alcohol and I'd assume that if you added lavender you also added alcohol which I am not a fan of with facial products. That being said, I've used this for years and I've never had an issue with it before, but I thought I should explain that I was using the old one without the lavender in it, still this is quite possibly my favourite face mask out of all the ones I have and will not stop using it unless I notice anything different with the new fragance, and just wondering what is the difference between this and the other competing brand I've seen.",R2SXUGI7766IX7,5.0,Looks okay,4.5,81.4,AFA26DYXVLJYTYZ3KET77GE27N2A,268,252,402115,90,100,[True]

If your hair is on the dry side well it leaves your hair kind of hay like and impossible to comb thru.  You really really need a detangler or good conditioner with it.

If you use a lot of product like gels and mousses and leave in conditioners I don't think this will remove those products from your hair.  Remember babies hair is virgin they don't color their hair or use all the products we do so don't expect this to remove products or help any way with color treated hair.

I'm extremely sensitive to scent & this does not bother me at all. The cream goes on just like sunscreen.  A bit thick, white, takes a bit to soak into the skin, feels a bit tacky and doesn't allow my makeup to sit right.

I was eager to try out their shower gel and I love the scent of roses so this seemed like a good option. For scent, the initial scent is great.  Smells just like roses.  However, the scent quickly changes to something else for me.  I'm not sure if it's the Murumuru butter, or another ingredient, but after the initial blast of rose fragrance, it starts to smell like sawdust for me, which isn't very appealing.  It's not horrible, but I wish the rose fragrance stayed longer. The bottle itself is ok.  The particular one I have is the pump bottle and while it works fine and hasn't had issues, I wish they would have extended the spout just a bit further out.  If you're using a bath poof you have to really squish it to get it under the nozzle and make sure you don't miss.
