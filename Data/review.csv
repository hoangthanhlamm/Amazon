So I‚Äôll leave the same review for both products. I was burdened with acne my whole life, not overly burdened with wide spread rash-like acne, but at least 5-10 on my face at one time. Once any part of my skin breaks or cuts it takes months to heal so I had to constantly conceal a lot of sores on my face with makeup. I had them on my neck too. I couldn‚Äôt use many moisturizers or I would just drip with oil. In my adult life my skin changed and was less oily and I could moisturize, but the acne continued. My face has never felt smooth and even to my touch and that always bothered me. Today it feels as soft as I imagine a healthy 20 year old‚Äôs would, and I‚Äôm 55! The other product I used in conjunction, and before using this one, was ‚Äú Copper Peptide Face Serum Collagen‚Äú by Complete Skin Solutions. It‚Äôs the one that is blue (true copper.) Both of these products are now a necessity for me because one of them has changed my skin beautifully, and I‚Äôm so thankful for finding a formulation that cleared the microscopic uneven feeling of my face. It even looks smoother with smaller pores. I don‚Äôt have to wear heavy clogging foundation anymore. Just a tinted moisturizer and I‚Äôm good to go. Fabulous.

It's rare I get a reaction from skincare products.  However I woke up several mornings with blemishes on my face since using it.  As a licensed Esthetician who has been in the industry for several years, I have to say RETINOL PRODUCTS ARE A WASTE OF MONEY.  If you want real results I recommend consulting a Dermatologist about a low does prescription of Retin-A topical cream and mix it in with your moisturizer at night.  Retin-A is highly effective when addressing anti-aging when used properly under the supervision of a dermatologist.  Whatever Retinol or Retin-A product you use, it  is crucial you only use them at night before bed and apply sunscreen regularly during the day even when it's overcast or cloudy.

[False],0,B07GC74LL5,"I have sensitive skin and I know RIGHT AWAY when a new product is causing an allergic reaction for me. When I first used this product I had no bad reaction to it and thought I was in the clear. It‚Äôs gentle on my skin and was helping my skin look clean. But... 4 weeks into using this once a day (at night) I started developing cystic acne and other small bumps on my cheek. I thought ‚Äúokay maybe I‚Äôm ‚Äòpurging‚Äô?‚Äù But NO. Keep in mind that purging ONLY happens when you are using active ingredients i.g. (retinol, AHAs, BHAs etc.) This product does not have any active ingredients in it, meaning there‚Äôs no positive cell turnover, and cannot get deep into your pores. Which is what would cause the purging. Cetaphil is simply just to ‚Äúclean‚Äù your skin so don‚Äôt expect it to clear or do anything for your acne. Another thing to keep in mind with this cleanser is it does nothing to retain moisture. So it will dry you out, make sure to follow up with a good moisturizer after while your skin is still damp after washing it off. This cleanser  doesn‚Äôt contain Hyaluronic Acid which is a key ingredient for helping your skin by helping bind collagen and hold the water in our skin. This may work for some people and if it works for you, that‚Äôs great, I encourage you to continue using it! But for me, I felt like it caused more issues rather than taking the issues away. Please give yourself time to check it out (4 weeks or so) and research into certain products. I wish I had done more research before buying this product or I would have gone with something else but unfortunately you just never know something will work for you, unless you try and that‚Äôs especially with skincare!
